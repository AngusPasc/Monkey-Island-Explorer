[44]
Annotation=What are you bugging me for?

[45]
Annotation=This is easy mode!

[46]
Annotation=Whew!

[47]
Annotation=That was a close one!

[48]
Annotation="If I didn't have my flame-resistant apron on, I would've been killed!"

[49]
Annotation=Well?

[50]
Annotation=Stan's Previously-Owned Restauraunt Supply...

[51]
Annotation=Why do you ask?

[52]
Annotation=What?!?

[53]
Annotation=I'm...

[54]
Annotation=...dead?

[55]
Annotation=Big Whoop?

[56]
Annotation="But, I'm not ready to die!"

[57]
Annotation=I feel my soul is not at peace.

[58]
Annotation=There is something I must do before I pass on.

[59]
Annotation=Ha ha ha!

[60]
Annotation=No.

[61]
Annotation=I just have this nagging feeling I left the gas on in my restaurant.

[62]
Annotation=It's driving me crazy.

[63]
Annotation=I'll take that secret with me to my grave!

[64]
Annotation=What are you talking about?

[65]
Annotation="Oh, will there ever be relief for my tortured soul?"

[66]
Annotation=Did you turn it off?

[67]
Annotation=Thanks.

[68]
Annotation=You can have my part of the map to Big Whoop--

[69]
Annotation='--but only if you do me a favor first.

[70]
Annotation=Could you check the gas in my weenie hut for me?

[71]
Annotation=Thanks.  Here's the key.

[72]
Annotation=Pleeeeease?

[73]
Annotation=Check the gas and I'll throw you the whip.

[74]
Annotation="I mean, give you the map."

[75]
Annotation=I guess where I'm going I won't need this map anyway.

[76]
Annotation=Now I can rest in the folds of the earth...

[77]
Annotation="...like a Steamin' Weenie in a soft, fresh bun."

[78]
Annotation=Ahhh...

[79]
Annotation=Check the gas and I'll give you the map.

[80]
Annotation=Oh yeah?

[81]
Annotation=Well... me too.

[82]
Annotation="Well, where's the mail boat?"

[83]
Annotation=Was THAT it?

[84]
Annotation=I see.

[85]
Annotation="OK, now who's gonna be next?"

[86]
Annotation=Are you pirates or not?

[87]
Annotation="Two, four, six, eight!"

[88]
Annotation="Come on, let's expectorate!"

[89]
Annotation=Everybody already has the necessary equipment.

[90]
Annotation=Turn a disgusting habit into a prestige-winning skill!

[91]
Annotation=Don't let this grass wither up and die!

[92]
Annotation=What was that?  Did I hear somebody swallow?

[93]
Annotation=What a waste!

[94]
Annotation=Thousands will spit.  Hundreds will win!

[95]
Annotation=No volunteers?  If Blackbeard were here he'd shoot you all right now.

[96]
Annotation=It's a great day for spitting!

[97]
Annotation=Don't be shy!  Let it fly!

[98]
Annotation=I know you want to volunteer...

[99]
Annotation=...it's on the tip of your tongue.

[100]
Annotation=You think spitting is gross?

[101]
Annotation=I'll tell you what's gross--

[102]
Annotation=Swallowing that stuff is gross.

[103]
Annotation=Prove to me that you guys are at least as fun as a pack of llamas.

[104]
Annotation=I hear there are some scouts here from the pro spitting circuit...

[105]
Annotation=This may be your last chance at popularity and success!

[106]
Annotation=Just look at this juicy crowd!

[107]
Annotation=Step up to the line and test your swill!

[108]
Annotation=Valuable prizes!

[109]
Annotation=Even a child can do it!

[110]
Annotation="In fact, they do it very well!"

[111]
Annotation=Come on.  It's all paid for by Booty Island Parks and Rec!

[112]
Annotation=Just put your two lips together and blow!

[113]
Annotation=A volunteer!

[114]
Annotation="Alright, settle down folks."

[115]
Annotation=This kid looks like a serious contender.

[116]
Annotation="What's your name, boy?"

[117]
Annotation=The Juice Man!

[118]
Annotation=Max Mucus!

[119]
Annotation=He's juicy to the max!

[120]
Annotation=The Phlegmster!

[121]
Annotation=The Phlegmalizer!

[122]
Annotation=The Master of Phlegm!

[123]
Annotation=The Loogster!

[124]
Annotation=Loog-o-rama!

[125]
Annotation=Hockin' the big ones for fame and fortune!

[126]
Annotation="Oh, no.  Dry tongue at the last minute!"

[127]
Annotation="Well, what about you folks?"

[128]
Annotation=Dribble Boy is back!

[129]
Annotation=Juicious Maximus has returned!

[130]
Annotation="The Phlegm Master, ready for his comeback!"

[131]
Annotation=Captain Loogie is in the house!

[132]
Annotation=Spit away!

[133]
Annotation=Misfire!  Misfire!

[134]
Annotation=Everybody run!

[135]
Annotation="Maybe a little over the max on the juice, there."

[136]
Annotation="Well, so much for the Phlegm Master."

[137]
Annotation="Gee, that's too bad, Captain."

[138]
Annotation="Well, better luck next time, Dribble Boy."

[139]
Annotation="Let's give him a big hand anyway, folks."

[140]
Annotation=At least he tried.

[141]
Annotation=He's cleared first place!

[142]
Annotation="Of course, there are plenty more prizes for the rest of you."

[143]
Annotation="So how about it, gang?"

[144]
Annotation=That was truly awe-inspiring!

[145]
Annotation="Sports fans, we've seen something incredible here today!"

[146]
Annotation=Let me congratulate you and give you this fine commemorative plaque.

[147]
Annotation=I think you've earned the title `Phlegm Master` now.

[148]
Annotation=You truly are the Master of Phlegm.

[149]
Annotation="I salute you, Captain Loogie."

[150]
Annotation="Way to go, Juicious."

[151]
Annotation="Come on, let's give him a hand."

[152]
Annotation=What's this?  A surprise turnaround in performance?

[153]
Annotation=It looks like he's rallying!

[154]
Annotation="Hey, he's been working out!"

[155]
Annotation="Oh, and I thought he was going to go all the way."

[156]
Annotation=Looks like someone stopped practicing.

[157]
Annotation="Oooh, he's slipping folks."

[158]
Annotation="Well, no records here."

[159]
Annotation=At least he's consistent.

[160]
Annotation=Once again...

[161]
Annotation=Looks like second place.

[162]
Annotation=Looks like third place.

[163]
Annotation=That doesn't quite qualify.

[164]
Annotation=...but...

[165]
Annotation=I think that deserves a little applause...

[166]
Annotation=Too bad there are only prizes for first place.

[167]
Annotation=Better luck next time.

[168]
Annotation="Now, how about the rest of you?"

[169]
Annotation=I'm sick of that old codger and his false alarms!

[170]
Annotation=Sounds like old Augustus spotted the mail boat!

[171]
Annotation=Again?

[172]
Annotation=False alarm.

[173]
Annotation=As I was saying...

[174]
Annotation="Sorry, kid."

[175]
Annotation=Only one plaque to a spitter.

[176]
Annotation="Sounds like it, too."

[177]
Annotation="Well, we figured since..."

[178]
Annotation=Gee...

[179]
Annotation=Hmmm...  Maybe THAT'S the mail boat.

[180]
Annotation=That sounds like the mail boat!

[181]
Annotation=I'd better fire the cannon!

[182]
Annotation=That oughta do it.

[183]
Annotation="Course, I don't see no mail boat..."

[184]
Annotation=Thought I heard it...

[185]
Annotation=Uh... Maybe?

[186]
Annotation=Hey!  Don't touch that!

[187]
Annotation=We only set that off when the mail boat comes in.

[188]
Annotation="Oh yes.  Well, are you enjoying Mardi Gras?"

[189]
Annotation="Oh, why hello there Threepwood."

[190]
Annotation=You in town for Mardi Gras?

[191]
Annotation=How about just blowing off?

[192]
Annotation="My name is Augustus DeWaat, not `old man.`"

[193]
Annotation=And this cannon is for official purposes only.

[194]
Annotation="I watch the sea, and when the mail boat arrives, I blow this cannon."

[195]
Annotation=Dang ship's three days late.

[196]
Annotation="Boy, the only Marty I know is Marty Graw!"

[197]
Annotation=Mardi Gras!

[198]
Annotation="It's a joke, boy, a joke."

[199]
Annotation="You are here for Mardi Gras, aren't you?"

[200]
Annotation=What?  They doin' a treasure hunt again this year?

[201]
Annotation=I can't believe they'd try that again after all the mishaps last time.

[202]
Annotation="Well, if it's a party your looking for..."

[203]
Annotation=I hear Governor Marley is having some super shindig up at her mansion.

[204]
Annotation="Son, it's always Mardi Gras on Booty Island."

[205]
Annotation=You kids today...

[206]
Annotation=...always on the go-go-go.

[207]
Annotation="Well, if it's fun you're looking for..."

[208]
Annotation=For money?

[209]
Annotation="Look, son, this ain't some back alley on Phatt."

[210]
Annotation=If you're looking for gambling you've come to the wrong place.

[211]
Annotation="Well, some people got carried away..."

[212]
Annotation=...some graves got dug up...

[213]
Annotation=...horrible business.

[214]
Annotation="Well, there's always Governor Marley's party."

[215]
Annotation=Oh sure...

[216]
Annotation="And I'll bet you helped her beat LeChuck, too."

[217]
Annotation="Yeah, live it up while you're young."

[218]
Annotation="Hey, hey, kid.  It's OK."

[219]
Annotation=Mardi Gras is the time for fantasy.

[220]
Annotation=Now just run along and enjoy yourself.

[221]
Annotation=I used to be the governor of this island.

[222]
Annotation=But I never had any time to come down here and enjoy the party.

[223]
Annotation="So I quit, and now I watch out for the mail boat."

[224]
Annotation="Which reminds me, I have to get back to work."

[225]
Annotation="Well, enjoy Mardi Gras."

[226]
Annotation="Sorry son, didn't have my horn out."

[227]
Annotation=Could you say that again?

[228]
Annotation="Eh, what was that?"

[229]
Annotation="You talking to me, boy?"

[230]
Annotation=You again?

[231]
Annotation="Still mumbling, I see."

[232]
Annotation=Speak up!

[233]
Annotation="There is a party going on, remember."

[234]
Annotation=What was that?

[235]
Annotation=Are you lost?

[236]
Annotation=How am I supposed to keep my ear to the sea with you bugging me all the time?

[237]
Annotation=Eh?

[238]
Annotation=WHUMP!

[239]
Annotation=--RING--

[240]
Annotation="Some party, eh?"

[241]
Annotation=Try the fish?

[242]
Annotation=Hear the one about the Polar Bear with the hairlip?

[243]
Annotation="Yeah, well.  You know."

[244]
Annotation=How's work?

[245]
Annotation=Like the music?

[246]
Annotation=Where'd you get the costume?

[247]
Annotation=Can I get you a refill?

[248]
Annotation=Pretty good turn out.

[249]
Annotation=Heard any new jokes?

[250]
Annotation=Gotta get the recipe for that fish.

[251]
Annotation=(Cheap sexual innuendo.)

[252]
Annotation=Blah BLAH blah...

[253]
Annotation="Yeah, well, you know."

[254]
Annotation=The wind was with me.

[255]
Annotation=No kidding.

[256]
Annotation=I forgot to put airholes in mine.

[257]
Annotation=I dunno.

[258]
Annotation=I guess to prove we're fun-loving guys?

[259]
Annotation=Yeah.  Got second place.

[260]
Annotation=Yep.

[261]
Annotation=Yeah.  Almost choked on a bone.

[262]
Annotation=Yeah.  Last week.

[263]
Annotation=Yeah.

[264]
Annotation="Same old, same old."

[265]
Annotation="Ah, I wore it last year."

[266]
Annotation=Nyah.  I'm fine.

[267]
Annotation=Yep.

[268]
Annotation=Not in months.

[269]
Annotation="Oh, yeah."

[270]
Annotation=(Mindless retort.)

[271]
Annotation=BLAH blah blah...

[272]
Annotation=Au contraire!

[273]
Annotation=This here's an indoor-outdoor model.

[274]
Annotation=Suitable for even the best of my Kozy Krypts!

[275]
Annotation=Sorry...

[276]
Annotation=Health regulations prohibit me from allowing uncertified persons free access to used internment paraphernalia.

[277]
Annotation="Well, yeah."

[278]
Annotation=But I decided to get into a business where unsatisfied customers are less likely to come back and complain.

[279]
Annotation=Of course we do funerals!

[280]
Annotation="And not just those somber, all-black, three-handkerchief affairs..."

[281]
Annotation="We do it in a rowdy Mardi Gras style, with music and dancing and pallbearer races..."

[282]
Annotation=I like to say we put the FUN in FUNerals.

[283]
Annotation=Heh heh.

[284]
Annotation=It's never too early to make funeral arangements.

[285]
Annotation=Making plot reservations now insures you a space at our popular Scabb Island Internment Park...

[286]
Annotation=...as well as entitling you to discounts on park rentals.

[287]
Annotation="You know--for barbecues, parties--that sort of thing."

[288]
Annotation="Well, you came to the right place!"

[289]
Annotation=`Your loved ones deserve Stan's special preserve.`

[290]
Annotation=`You won't smell a whiff When we're done with your stiff.`

[291]
Annotation=Maybe sooner than you think.

[292]
Annotation=Can I show you anything else?

[293]
Annotation=I see.

[294]
Annotation=I think cremation might be more appropriate in this instance.

[295]
Annotation="Here, take this complimentary hankie."

[296]
Annotation="Just my way of saying, `I care.`"

[297]
Annotation=HOWDY!!!

[298]
Annotation=Most of it used only for a few hours...

[299]
Annotation="...premature burial, you know.  That sort of thing."

[300]
Annotation="Well, speak up.  Or are you dead?"

[301]
Annotation="Either way, you came to the right place."

[302]
Annotation=Welcome to Stan's Previously Owned Coffins!

[303]
Annotation=We handle the dead for a lot less bread.

[304]
Annotation="What are you looking for, son?"

[305]
Annotation=Need a bin for your next of kin?

[306]
Annotation=Want a family plot without spending a lot?

[307]
Annotation=You're in luck!

[308]
Annotation=Just look at all this quality merchandise!

[309]
Annotation=Never before touched by a living soul.

[310]
Annotation="Yes, a man can really rest in peace AND comfort with one of these."

[311]
Annotation=Why should a man's coffin be any smaller than his bunk at sea?

[312]
Annotation=I could spend a lot of time in a coffin like this.

[313]
Annotation=Look at how freely I can wiggle my toes.

[314]
Annotation=This thing's bigger than my kitchen!

[315]
Annotation="You know, a person's coffin should reflect their station in life."

[316]
Annotation="If you're thinking about one of those cheaper models, first ask yourself,"

[317]
Annotation=`Isn't my loved one worth the best?`

[318]
Annotation=This is truly the casket of captains.

[319]
Annotation="When you've spent your life on something as big as the ocean,"

[320]
Annotation=how can you spend your death in anything smaller?

[321]
Annotation="Well, well, well."

[322]
Annotation=I knew you'd come back.

[323]
Annotation=There's enough room in here for a pirate AND his parrot.

[324]
Annotation=Feel free to join me.  There's room for both of us!

[325]
Annotation=I could just stay in here all day.

[326]
Annotation=If you should ever need to turn in your grave...

[327]
Annotation=...you could in here with comfort and ease.

[328]
Annotation="Even though it is used, you'll notice it still has that new coffin smell."

[329]
Annotation="I don't mean to scare you, but anything smaller than this and we might have to cut off your loved one's feet."

[330]
Annotation="Take it from me, I'm as claustrophobic as they come, and I love it in here."

[331]
Annotation="This baby's so nice, it should be illegal--"

[332]
Annotation=It makes people want to die.

[333]
Annotation=I've got one of these in the back for when I go.

[334]
Annotation=Just take a look at this convenient beverage holder.

[335]
Annotation=My customers always do.

[336]
Annotation=...EVENTUALLY.

[337]
Annotation=We also stock an excellent worm repellent that I might just throw in for free.

[338]
Annotation="You gotta admit, it's cozy."

[339]
Annotation=Do I not look cozy in here?

[340]
Annotation=I hear you knocking up there.

[341]
Annotation=That's solid oak you're hearing!

[342]
Annotation=Yes it sure is nice in here.

[343]
Annotation=It's just as roomy closed.

[344]
Annotation="Here, let me show you..."

[345]
Annotation=See?

[346]
Annotation=Hey!  I think the lid's stuck!

[347]
Annotation="Uh...  Excuse me, friend..."

[348]
Annotation=Could you see if the clasp is closed on this thing?

[349]
Annotation=I seem to be stuck...

[350]
Annotation=Hello?

[351]
Annotation=Is there anybody out there?

[352]
Annotation=Yoo-hoo?

[353]
Annotation="Hey, welcome back!"

[354]
Annotation=Help!

[355]
Annotation=I can't get out of here!

[356]
Annotation="OK, a joke's a joke, now GET ME OUT OF HERE!"

[357]
Annotation=Open this coffin right now!

[358]
Annotation=Anybody?

[359]
Annotation=I really am claustrophobic.

[360]
Annotation=Someone's going to pay for this.

[361]
Annotation="I'd bust out of here, but the dang thing's built too well."

[362]
Annotation="Well, if I had to be stuck in a coffin, at least it's the deluxe model."

[363]
Annotation=It really is pretty roomy in here.

[364]
Annotation=I almost forgot.

[365]
Annotation=I wanted you to have this complimentary hankie.

[366]
Annotation="Just my way of saying, `I care.`"

[367]
Annotation="Now, where were we?"

[368]
Annotation=Oh yeah.

[369]
Annotation=Maybe I'll take a nap.

[370]
Annotation=I hope this thing's not airtight.

[371]
Annotation=I'm not dead!

[372]
Annotation=I'm losing valuable business.

[373]
Annotation=Let me out!  I need to go to the bathroom.

[374]
Annotation="Hey, kid.  Don't be touching that."

[375]
Annotation=Sure!

[376]
Annotation=Okeydokey!

[377]
Annotation=Alrighty...

[378]
Annotation=Yessiree!

[379]
Annotation="Sure, sure.  Try out the lid operation."

[380]
Annotation=It's just as roomy closed.

[381]
Annotation="Heck, why not?"

[382]
Annotation=No problemo!

[383]
Annotation=What an excellent idea!

[384]
Annotation=I was just going to suggest that myself.

[385]
Annotation=Of course!

[386]
Annotation="Hey, anything you say!"

[387]
Annotation=Of course it is!

[388]
Annotation=I just went to the bank!

[389]
Annotation=Now get me out of here!

[390]
Annotation="Hey, take your time.  No hurry."

[391]
Annotation=Are you still out there?

[392]
Annotation=Hello?

[393]
Annotation=Bye now!

[394]
Annotation=Uh... be there in a minute.

[395]
Annotation=They must have fused with the teflon gasket!

[396]
Annotation="Oh Lord, I'm doomed!"

[397]
Annotation="Oooh, that hurts."

[398]
Annotation="Well, it's complicated..."

[399]
Annotation=Pricing here at Stan's works on a sliding scale...

[400]
Annotation=...based on one's ability to pay...

[401]
Annotation=...so as to make a decent funeral affordable to even our poorest customers.

[402]
Annotation="So, how much dough do you have on you?"

[403]
Annotation=They JUST raised the casket tax.

[404]
Annotation=Now this baby's going for 6500 pieces of eight.

[405]
Annotation="I have to warn you, I've got five other dead guys coming to look at this today."

[406]
Annotation=Have you decided to buy?

[407]
Annotation=Here--let me get in and show you.

[408]
Annotation=Now this isn't just your average sixty-gallon coffin.

[409]
Annotation=This has the full seventy-five gallons you need to avoid unsightly bone readjustments.

[410]
Annotation=Good solid construction on this baby.

[411]
Annotation=`It keeps out the worms while your body firms.`

[412]
Annotation=Amazing!

[413]
Annotation="When you first walked in here I said, `Now THERE'S a guy who needs a good used coffin!`"

[414]
Annotation=There happens to be an excellent deal right behind you.

[415]
Annotation=Let's go take a look-see.

[416]
Annotation=Now this here...

[417]
Annotation=...is the Cadillac of Coffins.

[418]
Annotation=Look at all that leg room!

[419]
Annotation=There's room in there for Long John Silver himself!

[420]
Annotation=With pleasure.

[421]
Annotation=Don't you patronize me.

[422]
Annotation=I'm a scholar.

[423]
Annotation=He probably keeps it in his office down the hall.

[424]
Annotation=Find the key yet?

[425]
Annotation=Okeydokey.

[426]
Annotation=Mr. Brush?

[427]
Annotation=Is that you?

[428]
Annotation=I thought you'd never come back.

[429]
Annotation=Well?

[430]
Annotation=It was horrible!

[431]
Annotation=They abducted me in my office...

[432]
Annotation=...brought me here in a duffel bag...

[433]
Annotation=...interrogated me...

[434]
Annotation=Then they...

[435]
Annotation=...they...

[436]
Annotation=They took away my monocle for awhile.

[437]
Annotation=You think this is funny?

[438]
Annotation=Yes I have.  Thanks for noticing.

[439]
Annotation=What?

[440]
Annotation=You can't leave me in here!

[441]
Annotation="Oh, LeChuck's got it, but who cares?"

[442]
Annotation="Yes, I memorized the whole thing before he took it."

[443]
Annotation="It's on an island called Dinky, not too far from here."

[444]
Annotation="After you bust me out of here, we could steal a boat and go there!"

[445]
Annotation=I knew it!

[446]
Annotation=He's always envied my intellectual look.

[447]
Annotation="What, are you nuts?"

[448]
Annotation=Go get the key.

[449]
Annotation=Sorry.

[450]
Annotation=Yeah.

[451]
Annotation=He should have let me go to the bathroom when I asked!

[452]
Annotation=Yep.

[453]
Annotation=Yeah?

[454]
Annotation=Good question.

[455]
Annotation=He didn't say what he was going to do to me?

[456]
Annotation=Yeah?

[457]
Annotation="Let's keep our heads, shall we?"

[458]
Annotation="Yeah, right after you kiss my butt."

[459]
Annotation=Just a second!

[460]
Annotation=Shhhh!

[461]
Annotation=Well...

[462]
Annotation="...I have one, but it's kind of embarrassing..."

[463]
Annotation=Oh...

[464]
Annotation="OK, I'll do it."

[465]
Annotation=But you have to close your eyes.

[466]
Annotation="Close your eyes, unless you want to become undead furniture."

[467]
Annotation=Bad feeling!?!

[468]
Annotation=LeChuck's got you hanging in chains over a pit of acid and all you've got is a bad feeling?!?

[469]
Annotation=Just leave me alone.

[470]
Annotation=Well...

[471]
Annotation="...actually, I was hoping you'd think of something."

[472]
Annotation=Hey!

[473]
Annotation=Watch it with the spit!

[474]
Annotation=Hey!

[475]
Annotation=Watch it with the spit!

[476]
Annotation=Yeah.  Can I go to the bathroom?

[477]
Annotation=Hmmm...

[478]
Annotation=Let's go!

[479]
Annotation=What are you waiting for?

[480]
Annotation=I don't think he's got the lips for it.

[481]
Annotation=C'mon!  What are you?  Afraid?

[482]
Annotation=Shouldn't he be disqualified by now?

[483]
Annotation=Let 'er rip!

[484]
Annotation=Spit!

[485]
Annotation=Come on!

[486]
Annotation=You can do it!

[487]
Annotation="Better not blow it, man."

[488]
Annotation=Hey spitter hey spitter hey spitter...

[489]
Annotation=You stink!

[490]
Annotation="Hummm, baby!"

[491]
Annotation=Right on!

[492]
Annotation="Hey, nice stick."

[493]
Annotation=Thanks.  Don't need it.

[494]
Annotation="No, thanks."

[495]
Annotation=I've got my own.

[496]
Annotation=You keep them.

[497]
Annotation=I've got plenty.

[498]
Annotation="No, thanks."

[499]
Annotation=Got plenty of my own.

[500]
Annotation="Sorry, I don't give refunds."

[501]
Annotation=I can't do anything with that slimy thing.

[502]
Annotation="No, thanks."

[503]
Annotation=That's me.

[504]
Annotation=It's not a toy.

[505]
Annotation=Hmmm... looks like a valuable antique.

[506]
Annotation=Be careful with it.

[507]
Annotation=Looks fine to me.

[508]
Annotation=Hmmm... looks like a massive fracture.

[509]
Annotation="If you're gonna be using this, I'd better reinforce it for ya."

[510]
Annotation="Here ya go, Boy."

[511]
Annotation=Steel shank...

[512]
Annotation=Alloy splints...

[513]
Annotation=Better than new.

[514]
Annotation=I need all of them.

[515]
Annotation=It's not for sale.

[516]
Annotation=I fought hard for that baby.

[517]
Annotation=No one touches her but me.

[518]
Annotation=Everything's laid out just how I need it.

[519]
Annotation=Just bring the hammer back when you're done with it.

[520]
Annotation=It's adjusted to my height.

[521]
Annotation="Thanks, I made it myself."

[522]
Annotation=I made it myself.

[523]
Annotation=That's one piece of eight.

[524]
Annotation=Anything else?

[525]
Annotation=Hey!  Don't touch that!

[526]
Annotation=Sure thing.

[527]
Annotation="Oh, no you don't!"

[528]
Annotation=Get your hands away from there!

[529]
Annotation=What do you think you're doing?

[530]
Annotation=Just put it back on the hook and I won't press charges.

[531]
Annotation=Yeah?

[532]
Annotation=He really goes against my grain!

[533]
Annotation=I'd like to make an end table out of him...

[534]
Annotation=but I don't have the guts.

[535]
Annotation="With all my tools, I'm still unable to create the one thing that could do this island some good."

[536]
Annotation="No, like a voodoo doll of Largo LaGrande!"

[537]
Annotation="No, I'm a woodsmith."

[538]
Annotation=Which gives one of us an excuse for dressing funny.

[539]
Annotation=A woodchuck could chuck no amount of wood since a woodchuck can't chuck wood.

[540]
Annotation="Even if a woodchuck could chuck wood,  and even if a woodchuck would chuck wood,  should a woodchuck chuck wood?"

[541]
Annotation=Oh.  Shut up.

[542]
Annotation="Hey, you started it."

[543]
Annotation=Hey!  Don't touch those!

[544]
Annotation=Get away from there!

[545]
Annotation=Thanks for returning that.

[546]
Annotation=Funny.

[547]
Annotation=That looks just like my hammer...

[548]
Annotation=... which I have been missing.

[549]
Annotation=Could you just put it back on the hook for me?

[550]
Annotation="OK, but don't touch anything."

[551]
Annotation="Yeah, I heard Marty stuck a bunch of pins in his underwear or something..."

[552]
Annotation=...drove him right out of town.

[553]
Annotation=You?

[554]
Annotation=What were you doing with Largo's underwear?

[555]
Annotation=Help yourself to as many as you'd like.

[556]
Annotation=Blah BLAH blah...

[557]
Annotation=Nice mask.

[558]
Annotation=Not that paper mache is very expensive...

[559]
Annotation="Yeah, whatever."

[560]
Annotation="Still, you must have saved a bundle."

[561]
Annotation="Well, I didn't mean you were cheap..."

[562]
Annotation=I just meant...

[563]
Annotation=I'm sure it must be hard--

[564]
Annotation="No, no.  It looks great!"

[565]
Annotation=I just said it looked... subtle.

[566]
Annotation=Yeah.  OK.  Fine.

[567]
Annotation=More subtle than most.

[568]
Annotation="Not your usual, larger-than-life,"

[569]
Annotation=Mardi Gras head.

[570]
Annotation="Probably saved a lot on materials, huh?"

[571]
Annotation=Yep.

[572]
Annotation=Yeah.  Almost choked on a bone.

[573]
Annotation=Yeah.  Last week.

[574]
Annotation=Yeah.

[575]
Annotation="Same old, same old."

[576]
Annotation=It's alright.

[577]
Annotation="Ah, I wore it last year."

[578]
Annotation=Nyah.  I'm fine.

[579]
Annotation=Yep.

[580]
Annotation=Not in months.

[581]
Annotation="Oh, yeah."

[582]
Annotation=(Mindless retort.)

[583]
Annotation=BLAH blah blah...

[584]
Annotation="Some party, eh?"

[585]
Annotation=Try the fish?

[586]
Annotation=Hear the one about the Polar Bear with the hairlip?

[587]
Annotation="Yeah, well.  You know."

[588]
Annotation=How's work?

[589]
Annotation=Like the music?

[590]
Annotation=Where'd you get the costume?

[591]
Annotation=Can I get you a refill?

[592]
Annotation=Pretty good turn out.

[593]
Annotation=Heard any new jokes?

[594]
Annotation=Gotta get the recipe for that fish.

[595]
Annotation=(Cheap sexual innuendo.)

[596]
Annotation=Your loss.

[597]
Annotation=That's an authentic pirate's fishhook.

[598]
Annotation=Found it inside a crocodile who was too petered out to move.

[599]
Annotation=Thanks for giving that to me.

[600]
Annotation=I think the parrot likes it.

[601]
Annotation=That's part of the Big Whoop treasure map.

[602]
Annotation="I don't know a lot about the piece, but there's supposed to be a book in the library that tells all about the whole map."

[603]
Annotation=That collectible plate is worth a mint.

[604]
Annotation=Those are authentic scale reproductions of rotting skulls rendered in sun-bleached whalebone.

[605]
Annotation=There's even some loose skin to hang them up from.

[606]
Annotation=Thanks.  I pride myself on the quality of my merchandise.

[607]
Annotation=I only sell the finest of pirate memorabilia.

[608]
Annotation=Even the trade-ins are first class.

[609]
Annotation=And I always make you the best deals.

[610]
Annotation=Volume.

[611]
Annotation=That's the legendary white whale.

[612]
Annotation="Never been caught, except on canvas."

[613]
Annotation=Dunno.

[614]
Annotation=Maybe.  Maybe not.

[615]
Annotation=Nothing says a whale must have a name.

[616]
Annotation=That's a Mark VII `devastator` triple-cannon emplacement.

[617]
Annotation=If only they'd thought to leave a hole for the fuse.

[618]
Annotation=You'd look good in one of those.

[619]
Annotation=And they're great for parties.

[620]
Annotation=I made that myself from my last parrot.

[621]
Annotation=Got too noisy for me.

[622]
Annotation=Check out these balls!

[623]
Annotation=They're made of a fine iron cast.

[624]
Annotation=I was told that these are used as a form of barter in the inner cities.

[625]
Annotation=I have an eyepatch in every shape.

[626]
Annotation=I got that as a gift from a man I saved few years ago.

[627]
Annotation="Don't have much use for a wheel, but he said one good turn deserves another."

[628]
Annotation=It was handmade by a good friend of mine from another island.

[629]
Annotation=That's the real thing!

[630]
Annotation="As seen in `Raiders`, `Temple`, `Holy Grail`, and `The Young Chronicles`."

[631]
Annotation=It's said that the infamous Greenbeard won that barrel from Long John Cooper in a poker game.

[632]
Annotation=Shame that it's empty.

[633]
Annotation=That's a real ship's horn just like the ones used on modern ships.

[634]
Annotation=It looks like Spiffy the Pinhead.

[635]
Annotation=It's ergonomically formulated to enhance stopping power.

[636]
Annotation=That's a great gift for the holidays.

[637]
Annotation=Found that beauty at the bottom of the sea.

[638]
Annotation=She cleaned up real nicely though.

[639]
Annotation=That's a sign I took from the famous Precipice View Road.

[640]
Annotation=They call it `Dead Man's Drop` now.

[641]
Annotation="Ah, the famous ceremonial lights from the pirates of the South Pacific."

[642]
Annotation=Those aren't for sale.

[643]
Annotation=It's a picture of a couple of wenches.

[644]
Annotation=It's a picture of a pirate with peg legs.

[645]
Annotation=The map piece is made of authentic parchment from the turn of the century.

[646]
Annotation=Can't find things like that anymore.

[647]
Annotation=About six million pieces o' eight.

[648]
Annotation=Well... I do have some nice fake maps for less.

[649]
Annotation=I'm not sure exactly what this is.

[650]
Annotation=It's a beautiful antique porcelain vase.

[651]
Annotation="Sorry, that sign's not for sale."

[652]
Annotation="Well, ah..."

[653]
Annotation=I guess I could sell it.

[654]
Annotation=You already bought the last one I have for sale.

[655]
Annotation=I need to keep at least one for a display model.

[656]
Annotation="Actually, those belong to my son."

[657]
Annotation=They aren't for sale.

[658]
Annotation=I just keep those here because they're cool.

[659]
Annotation=They're not for sale.

[660]
Annotation="Yeah, like you have one."

[661]
Annotation=But I do accept personal checks or trade-ins.

[662]
Annotation=I just couldn't part with those.

[663]
Annotation=They have sentimental value.

[664]
Annotation="Yah, I like that too."

[665]
Annotation=But it's not for sale.

[666]
Annotation=That's one of my favorite things in the store.

[667]
Annotation=But I don't have enough back stock to sell it.

[668]
Annotation="That's great, huh?"

[669]
Annotation=Too bad it's not for sale.

[670]
Annotation=I only have one of those.

[671]
Annotation=So I need to keep it as a display model.

[672]
Annotation="That's 6,000,000 pieces o' eight."

[673]
Annotation=Do you want it?

[674]
Annotation=Excellent choice.

[675]
Annotation=I see you have an eye for quality.

[676]
Annotation=Alrighty.

[677]
Annotation=Okeydokey.

[678]
Annotation=The ship was a huge galleon named The Mad Monkey.

[679]
Annotation=Nobody knows where it sank or why.

[680]
Annotation="But, the figurehead is supposed to be the most fabulous piece of art ever."

[681]
Annotation=That's why I want it.

[682]
Annotation="I'm a collector of fine art, as I'm sure you can see."

[683]
Annotation="I'll take most old swords,"

[684]
Annotation="some used parrots,"

[685]
Annotation="almost anything valuable made of bronze,"

[686]
Annotation=and a few old ship parts.

[687]
Annotation=No.  But there's one thing I might trade for the map piece.

[688]
Annotation=There was a certain ship that sunk and I'd really like the figurehead.

[689]
Annotation=I'd give you the map if you got the figurehead for me.

[690]
Annotation=Great!

[691]
Annotation=And I'd like to sell you one of them.

[692]
Annotation=And I'd like to sell it to you.

[693]
Annotation=That'll be 15 pieces o' eight.

[694]
Annotation=That'll be 20 pieces o' eight.

[695]
Annotation=That'll be 25 pieces o' eight.

[696]
Annotation=That'll be 5 pieces o' eight.

[697]
Annotation=That'll be 100 pieces o' eight.

[698]
Annotation=That'll be 20000 pieces o' eight.

[699]
Annotation=That'll be 199 pieces o' eight.

[700]
Annotation=They're 30 pieces o' eight each.

[701]
Annotation=That'll be 10 pieces o' eight.

[702]
Annotation=They're 50 pieces o' eight each.

[703]
Annotation=That'll be 40 pieces o' eight.

[704]
Annotation=Too bad.

[705]
Annotation="If you really want it, I could buy back some of the stuff you bought from me."

[706]
Annotation=It's yours.

[707]
Annotation=Let me get you one from overstock.

[708]
Annotation=Here you go.

[709]
Annotation=Oh yeah?

[710]
Annotation=What's so special about it?

[711]
Annotation=Really?!

[712]
Annotation=That would make it very valuable.

[713]
Annotation="And I do like bronze, anyway."

[714]
Annotation=I'll give you 6000 pieces o' eight for it.

[715]
Annotation=I'm not interested.

[716]
Annotation=Uh-huh.

[717]
Annotation=For a lump of pus on a shingle?

[718]
Annotation=Sure.

[719]
Annotation=No one leaves here unsatisfied.

[720]
Annotation="Heck, I'll even give you back what you paid for them."

[721]
Annotation="Heck, I'll even give you back what you paid for it."

[722]
Annotation="Well, I was feeling guilty about how much I charged you anyway."

[723]
Annotation="Hey, I'm a fair guy."

[724]
Annotation=Call me soft hearted.

[725]
Annotation="After all, this ain't Stan's."

[726]
Annotation=We aim to please.

[727]
Annotation=Hey!

[728]
Annotation="Take that thing outside, will ya?"

[729]
Annotation=The figurehead from the Mad Monkey!

[730]
Annotation="Ordinarily, I'd pay six million pieces o' eight for this."

[731]
Annotation=But I'm a bit short on the cash right now.

[732]
Annotation=I'll give you this Big Whoop map piece for it.

[733]
Annotation="Sorry, he's not for sale."

[734]
Annotation=HEY!  Don't do that to my parrot.

[735]
Annotation=He likes it where it is.

[736]
Annotation=Would you mind leaving that here?

[737]
Annotation=The parrot likes it even better than the mirror.

[738]
Annotation="Well, well, well."

[739]
Annotation=I didn't think anyone would ever get the Mad Monkey's figurehead.

[740]
Annotation=Sure.

[741]
Annotation=It's yours.

[742]
Annotation=Isn't he a beautiful parrot?

[743]
Annotation=I already have too many of those.

[744]
Annotation=I can't take that back.

[745]
Annotation=Some of the teeth are bent.

[746]
Annotation=Sorry kid.

[747]
Annotation=I don't do sports nostalgia.

[748]
Annotation=Get that piece of junk out of here.

[749]
Annotation=Hey!  That's thing's not sanitary anymore!

[750]
Annotation=Get it away from me!

[751]
Annotation="No, thanks."

[752]
Annotation=Mr. Polly likes that mirror.

[753]
Annotation=It's the law.

[754]
Annotation="Aw, don't be sore, kid."

[755]
Annotation=It's the law.

[756]
Annotation=And let's just say I want to keep on the good side of it.

[757]
Annotation=Let's just say I want to keep on the good side of it.

[758]
Annotation="Sorry, kid."

[759]
Annotation=You'll have to do better than that.

[760]
Annotation="No ID, no service."

[761]
Annotation=Free-lance?

[762]
Annotation=Is that anything like a sanitary engineer?

[763]
Annotation=Well...

[764]
Annotation=Unemployed??!

[765]
Annotation=Didn't I give you a job?

[766]
Annotation=Oh.

[767]
Annotation=Pirate?!

[768]
Annotation=We don't serve your type here.

[769]
Annotation=No. Just jerking your leg.

[770]
Annotation=Alright...

[771]
Annotation=Can I get you that drink now?

[772]
Annotation="OK, but gimmie back your empties..."

[773]
Annotation=I'm running out of glasses.

[774]
Annotation=Now...

[775]
Annotation=Name yer poison.

[776]
Annotation="Well, we have some speciality drinks here at the Bloody Lip..."

[777]
Annotation=Like:

[778]
Annotation="Yellow Beard's Baby, Bloody Stump, and Blue Whale."

[779]
Annotation="Well, you can try, but I don't think nature's on your side."

[780]
Annotation=Ha ha ha!

[781]
Annotation="Hey, I have to crack jokes."

[782]
Annotation=It's a union thing.

[783]
Annotation=Here you go.

[784]
Annotation=And here's a complimentary crazy straw.

[785]
Annotation=We give them to all new customers of The Bloody Lip.

[786]
Annotation="Yeah, alright."

[787]
Annotation=I can't. Chain saw's out of gas!

[788]
Annotation=Ha ha ha.

[789]
Annotation=Yeah. I crack myself up.

[790]
Annotation=Here you go.

[791]
Annotation=No.

[792]
Annotation=It's just terrible...

[793]
Annotation=No one ever comes down here anymore.

[794]
Annotation=Largo's got all my regulars spooked.

[795]
Annotation=Because the law around here isn't the law at all.

[796]
Annotation=It's Largo!

[797]
Annotation=It's not so much Largo as it is who his boss was.

[798]
Annotation=I'd rather not say any more about it.

[799]
Annotation=Sorry. Blender's not big enough!

[800]
Annotation=Ah ha ha!

[801]
Annotation=But seriously...

[802]
Annotation=There she blows!

[803]
Annotation="Don't have the stomach for it, eh?"

[804]
Annotation=You haven't even finished the one you got.

[805]
Annotation=Come on. Drink up.

[806]
Annotation=Yep.

[807]
Annotation=Sorry.

[808]
Annotation="That guy I hired is doing just fine, so far."

[809]
Annotation=You lookin' fer work?

[810]
Annotation=Just canned my cook.

[811]
Annotation="I do have a business to run, you know."

[812]
Annotation=Depends.

[813]
Annotation=Is there a good story behind it?

[814]
Annotation=Heard it.

[815]
Annotation="This is the one where he drinks too much root beer and burps so hard he explodes, right?"

[816]
Annotation="Frankly, I don't care much for stories that promote moderation in drinking."

[817]
Annotation=Sure is.

[818]
Annotation=You want it?

[819]
Annotation="Oh, yeah."

[820]
Annotation=I really should take that thing down.

[821]
Annotation=I hired a new cook just this morning.

[822]
Annotation="But, if things don't work out with him, I'll let you know."

[823]
Annotation="Well, well..."

[824]
Annotation=I guess all those laxatives I was slipping into his drinks finally got to him.

[825]
Annotation=Don't worry. I don't put them in all the drinks.

[826]
Annotation=Hey! Hired help only.

[827]
Annotation=Are you interested?

[828]
Annotation="Hey, can you cook?"

[829]
Annotation=How'd you like a career in the fast-paced world of pub-food cuisine?

[830]
Annotation=Yeah. You interested?

[831]
Annotation=Great! The job is yours.

[832]
Annotation=Here's a week's worth of wages.

[833]
Annotation="Now, go strap on an apron and get to work."

[834]
Annotation="Well, come back and see me if you change your mind."

[835]
Annotation=420 pieces of eight a week.

[836]
Annotation=First week paid in advance.

[837]
Annotation="Sure, sure."

[838]
Annotation=Take your time.

[839]
Annotation=Oh good. You've come back.

[840]
Annotation=Are you interested in the job now?

[841]
Annotation="Yeah, boy?"

[842]
Annotation=You're supposed to be cooking.

[843]
Annotation=Nice try.

[844]
Annotation=But not good enough.

[845]
Annotation=You're fired.

[846]
Annotation=Hey!

[847]
Annotation=Don't bug the monkey!

[848]
Annotation="Hey, what'd you do to my piano player?"

[849]

[868]

[869]

[877]

[878]

[879]

[880]

[883]

[884]
Annotation=Go ahead and take my entertainment.

[885]
Annotation="Thanks for nothing, buddy."

[886]
Annotation=It doesn't have any alcohol in it...

[887]
Annotation=...but it's just as nasty-smelling and foul-tasting as that stuff grown-ups drink.

[888]
Annotation="Oh, wait. What am I saying?"

[889]
Annotation=I just sold the last of it to Kate.

[890]

[891]

[901]

[902]
Annotation=I'll need to see some ID for that.

[903]
Annotation="You know, I can mix any drink there is..."

[904]
Annotation=That's all I have.

[905]
Annotation=I don't want to talk about it.

[906]
Annotation=...make anything you could name...

[907]
Annotation=...but I can't make the one thing that could really do this island some good.

[908]
Annotation=A voodoo doll of Largo LaGrande!

[909]
Annotation=(Uh-oh.)

[910]

[911]
Annotation=No spittin' in here.

[912]

[913]
Annotation=Nope.

[914]

[915]
Annotation=Dang.

[916]
Annotation=Just when I thought I was going to do a little business!

[917]
Annotation="Ah, the Courageous Captain Kate Capsize..."

[918]
Annotation="Tough as steel, sharp as nails."

[919]
Annotation=She rents her ship out...

[920]
Annotation=...does some free-lance pirating.

[921]
Annotation=Her only loyalty is to the highest bidder.

[922]
Annotation=Don't get on her bad side.

[923]
Annotation=Don't bug me. I'm cooking.

[924]
Annotation="I said, `Leave me alone!`"

[925]
Annotation=I'm trying to work.

[926]

Annotation="That reminds me, do we have any weenies left?"

[951]
Annotation=He used to be LeChuck's right-hand man.

[952]
Annotation=You don't want to get Largo on your bad side.

[953]
Annotation=He's nothing but a low-down weasel!

[954]
Annotation=But he was very close to LeChuck...

[955]
Annotation=I heard they never found his body!

[956]
Annotation="Some of us tried pirating on land, but it just didn't feel right."

[957]
Annotation="Well, it's not really an embargo."

[958]
Annotation=It's a tax on ships coming or going...

[959]
Annotation=Including Dread.

[960]
Annotation=Not really...

[961]
Annotation=...once you get to know him.

[962]
Annotation=That was beautiful.

[963]

[964]

[980]
Annotation="Oh, I wish I could par-lay Some French with Governor Marley."

[1255]
Annotation=I already told you that the number would be 9 red

[1256]
Annotation=No.

[1257]
Annotation=I said `NO!`

[1258]
Annotation=Leave me alone.

[1259]
Annotation=I'm tired of being hassled.

[1260]
Annotation="So... you want to sword fight, do you?"

[1261]
Annotation="Sword fighting is for wimps, weenies, and sissies."

[1262]
Annotation=I have a better way to solve a dispute.

[1263]
Annotation=Real pirates solve their differences with a drinking contest.

[1264]
Annotation=Come on in.

[1265]
Annotation=I'll get us set up.

[1266]
Annotation=This is my special grog.

[1267]
Annotation=It's just for contests.

[1268]
Annotation="Twice the alcohol, twice the calories."

[1269]
Annotation=I can't believe you're back for more.

[1270]
Annotation=Most people just give up and go away.

[1271]
Annotation="In fact, I'd really like it if you went away."

[1272]
Annotation=Don't you know when enough is enough?

[1273]
Annotation=You know you're not going to beat me.

[1274]
Annotation=I'm the best at this contest.

[1275]
Annotation=I wish I'd never bought this house.

[1276]
Annotation=It's only caused me trouble.

[1277]
Annotation=All these treasure hunters wanting to come in.

[1278]
Annotation=Excuse the boxes.

[1279]
Annotation=I haven't had time to put them all away.

[1280]
Annotation=Especially with all the people trying to get into my house.

[1281]
Annotation=I hate having to waste it.

[1282]
Annotation="Well, I guess you're serious about this contest."

[1283]
Annotation="OK, let's get on with it."

[1284]
Annotation=But I guess you want to go through with this.

[1285]
Annotation=Here's your drink...

[1286]
Annotation=Yes?  What do you want?

[1287]
Annotation=Are you sure you don't want to back out?

[1288]
Annotation=You drink first.

[1289]
Annotation=Just what I expected.

[1290]
Annotation=Typical.

[1291]
Annotation=Novice.

[1292]
Annotation=He's too young to drink anyway.

[1293]
Annotation="Oh, you already drank yours."

[1294]
Annotation=Boy!  You're good at this contest.

[1295]
Annotation=That was fast.

[1296]
Annotation=You must be thirsty.

[1297]
Annotation=Take mine.  I'll go get more.

[1298]
Annotation=Oh.  Your grog's a funny color.

[1299]
Annotation=It might have spoiled.

[1300]
Annotation="From what I'm told,"

[1301]
Annotation=It's a bit on the bitter side.

[1302]
Annotation=Makes your lips pucker.

[1303]
Annotation=It's rather sweet.

[1304]
Annotation=It's smooth as a pirate's savvy.

[1305]
Annotation=It's sharper than a forked tongue.

[1306]
Annotation=Tastes just like chicken.

[1307]
Annotation="You know, most of the treasure hunters just leave when I ask them to."

[1308]
Annotation=But it's powerful medicine.

[1309]
Annotation=But it's weaker than a sponge soaked in water.

[1310]
Annotation=But it hurts as it goes down.

[1311]
Annotation=Nobody can drink the special contest grog without feeling faint.

[1312]
Annotation=But it slides down the throat like fire.

[1313]
Annotation=But it's stronger than a mule team.

[1314]
Annotation=But it's got a wonderful aroma.

[1315]
Annotation=I guzzled it with the best of them.

[1316]
Annotation=Never could get enough of that stuff.

[1317]
Annotation=Used to drink it all the time.

[1318]
Annotation=I had cases and cases of it

[1319]
Annotation=All in one day.

[1320]
Annotation=Used to drink barrels and barrels of it.

[1321]
Annotation=My buddies and I drank it faster than we could open the bottles.

[1322]
Annotation=There's a special drink that I like.

[1323]
Annotation="It'll get you places in life, boy."

[1324]
Annotation=I could give it up anytime I wanted.

[1325]
Annotation=Then I came to my senses.

[1326]
Annotation=Then there was a shortage of it a few years ago.

[1327]
Annotation=Then my supply ran out...

[1328]
Annotation=And my girlfriend went with it.

[1329]
Annotation=Then the taxes on it were raised.

[1330]
Annotation=Then I realized that I relied on it to get up in the morning.

[1331]
Annotation=But it won't get you into my house.

[1332]
Annotation="But I needed something else,"

[1333]
Annotation=You ever tried booze from the West?

[1334]
Annotation=so I drank rum.

[1335]
Annotation=So I started drinking rum to fill the gap in my life.

[1336]
Annotation=That's why I started drinking rum.

[1337]
Annotation=That was when I took up rum.

[1338]
Annotation=My next drink of choice was rum.

[1339]
Annotation=So I switched to drinking rum.

[1340]
Annotation=I used to like this drink when I was younger...

[1341]
Annotation=I found this great drink from a foreign land.

[1342]
Annotation="On the ship, we had a drink that we couldn't live without."

[1343]
Annotation=My usual drink used to be a strange drink made by cannibals.

[1344]
Annotation=But I've been practicing.

[1345]
Annotation=But you.

[1346]
Annotation=You're persistent.

[1347]
Annotation=What do you REALLY want?

[1348]
Annotation="Back again, eh?"

[1349]
Annotation=Let's get this over with.

[1350]
Annotation=I knew it.

[1351]
Annotation=I'm sick of you would-be treasure hunters comin' over here.

[1352]
Annotation=I just inherited this house two months ago.

[1353]
Annotation="And every single day, all I've heard is `**rap tap tap**  Do you have a treasure here?`"

[1354]
Annotation=Why can't you people just go away and leave a retired pirate in peace?

[1355]
Annotation="If you want to put it that way, sir, yes."

[1356]
Annotation="Excuse me, sir."

[1357]
Annotation=Aren't you Guybrush Threepwood?

[1358]
Annotation="I'm sure that's a very interesting story, but we don't have time for that now."

[1359]
Annotation="Yes, sir, Governor Phatt."

[1360]
Annotation="Come on, you little weasel."

[1361]
Annotation=Come on!

[1362]
Annotation=Don't try to escape or anything.

[1363]
Annotation=Walt will chew you to bits.

[1364]
Annotation="OK, Walt, I'll be back to relieve you at eleven."

[1365]
Annotation=Excuse me.

[1366]
Annotation="Nice try, Guybrush."

[1367]
Annotation="I don't know how you got out of the jail, but I'm taking you back in."

[1368]
Annotation=Aren't you Guybrush Threepwood?

[1369]
Annotation="Kate, eh?"

[1370]
Annotation=That's an unusual name.

[1371]
Annotation=Perhaps you have some identification?

[1372]
Annotation="Smith, eh?"

[1373]
Annotation=That's an unusual name.

[1374]
Annotation="Hold on, sir."

[1375]
Annotation=Perhaps you have some identification?

[1376]
Annotation=That's the second lamest excuse I've ever heard.

[1377]
Annotation="Nice try, Guybrush."

[1378]
Annotation="I'm with the local constabulary, sir."

[1379]
Annotation="You'd better come with me, Governor Phatt would like a word with you."

[1380]
Annotation="Of course it has, sir."

[1381]
Annotation="Hey Guybrush!  It's me, Wally! The cartographer!"

[1382]
Annotation=Thank God you've come to rescue me!

[1383]
Annotation=Hey Guybrush! I'm over here!

[1384]
Annotation=Yo Ho!  I'm in the jail Guybrush

[1385]
Annotation=So I've heard.

[1386]
Annotation=Thanks. I can't see a thing without it.

[1387]
Annotation=Uh-huh.

[1388]
Annotation=Uh-oh. Who sent you here?

[1389]
Annotation=I should warn you: I'm heavily armed.

[1390]
Annotation=The who?

[1391]
Annotation=You'd better not try for my files.

[1392]
Annotation=All my research on Big Whoop is in there.

[1393]
Annotation="Well, that's a dangerous question."

[1394]
Annotation=I've been researching Big Whoop for years.

[1395]
Annotation=There are a lot of people who'd like to get their hands on my files.

[1396]
Annotation=You would be too if you were me.

[1397]
Annotation=Well...

[1398]
Annotation=I haven't really been able to find out much hard information...

[1399]
Annotation=What do YOU know about it?

[1400]
Annotation=Oh yes. Hi there.

[1401]
Annotation=Wally.

[1402]
Annotation=Wally B. Feed.

[1403]
Annotation=At your service.

[1404]
Annotation="Actually, there's not anything in them."

[1405]
Annotation=I don't know if I'd be much help.

[1406]
Annotation="You mean, you never heard of the four men who buried it?"

[1407]
Annotation=Because there's no such island.

[1408]
Annotation="Well, all anyone knows for sure is that there was a shipwreck."

[1409]
Annotation=The merchant vessel Elaine went down in a terrible storm.

[1410]
Annotation=Only four crew members survived.

[1411]
Annotation="They washed up on a remote, deserted island."

[1412]
Annotation="Some say it's name was `Inky Island,`"

[1413]
Annotation=but I don't believe that.

[1414]
Annotation="Anyway, that's where they supposedly found Big Whoop."

[1415]
Annotation=Did you pick up my love potion?

[1416]
Annotation=But if I could just see the map of that island...

[1417]
Annotation=...I bet I could recognize the shape of the land and track it down myself.

[1418]
Annotation="Well, I don't even know their names."

[1419]
Annotation="You know, that reminds me..."

[1420]
Annotation=I've got to get over to the Phatt City library and look that up...

[1421]
Annotation="Whatever it was, it was so wonderful..."

[1422]
Annotation=...or so horrible...

[1423]
Annotation=...that they never wanted anyone else to find it.

[1424]
Annotation=So they took the map they made of the island...

[1425]
Annotation=...and split it up among the four of them.

[1426]
Annotation=And they all went their separate ways.

[1427]
Annotation="Of course, it could just be an old legend."

[1428]
Annotation=...I'd go look them up at the Phatt City library...

[1429]
Annotation=...if it weren't for this stupid Largo Embargo!

[1430]
Annotation="Well, well."

[1431]
Annotation="Guess you don't need me, then."

[1432]
Annotation=That's great.

[1433]
Annotation=I guess I can stop with the bricks through his window now.

[1434]
Annotation=Hey! Me too.

[1435]
Annotation=Who couldn't?

[1436]
Annotation=What else is there to talk about?

[1437]
Annotation="Well, hey. That's my job."

[1438]
Annotation=Seems almost like we have.

[1439]
Annotation=Hello.

[1440]
Annotation=I'm a cartographer.

[1441]
Annotation=Uh... no.

[1442]
Annotation=I'm the mapmaking sort of cartographer.

[1443]
Annotation=Yep.

[1444]
Annotation=It's so cute when you laypeople try to understand geography.

[1445]
Annotation="I could try to explain it, but it would probably just go over your head."

[1446]
Annotation="If you see my monocle, let me know."

[1447]
Annotation="No, no. Be my guest."

[1448]
Annotation=Every kind a pirate could need!

[1449]
Annotation="My eyes have seen the whole world, and there's not a part of it I haven't put down on paper."

[1450]
Annotation="Well, I do some restoration work too."

[1451]
Annotation="I paste them together, re-copy them..."

[1452]
Annotation=...paint little cupids in the corners...

[1453]
Annotation=...you know. Artsy-fartsy stuff.

[1454]
Annotation="Maps are very, very important."

[1455]
Annotation=That's even better!

[1456]
Annotation="With good maps, you can see the whole world without leaving your living room."

[1457]
Annotation=That's what Magellan thought.

[1458]
Annotation=Ha ha ha!

[1459]
Annotation=Sorry. Cartographer joke.

[1460]
Annotation=Can I help you?

[1461]
Annotation=He's just the local hood--shakes down everybody in town.

[1462]
Annotation=Nobody comes or goes from Scabb because Largo makes them pay through the nose.

[1463]
Annotation=Terrible!

[1464]
Annotation=No one needs any maps since no one can go anywhere thanks to Largo.

[1465]
Annotation=There is no Governor on Scabb!

[1466]
Annotation="This is an anarchist cooperative of pirates, cutthroats, and other criminals."

[1467]
Annotation=A haven for roughnecks and rebels like me.

[1468]
Annotation=The only authority on this island is that bully Largo.

[1469]
Annotation="Well, I hear there's a new chef down at the Bloody Lip."

[1470]
Annotation=And the Swamp Rot Inn has all the comforts of the sea.

[1471]
Annotation=But I think Largo's booked the whole thing.

[1472]
Annotation=Maybe you should talk to Captain Dread.

[1473]
Annotation=Okay. But don't be shy if you think of a question.

[1474]
Annotation=Okeydokey.

[1475]
Annotation=Anytime.

[1476]
Annotation=Why? Thinking about moving here?

[1477]
Annotation=Good luck!

[1478]
Annotation="With the sailing embargo Largo's imposed on Scabb, it's hard to get anywhere."

[1479]
Annotation="Which doesn't help my business, let me tell you."

[1480]
Annotation=Hey! Where's my monocle!

[1481]
Annotation=I can't see a thing without me monocle!

[1482]
Annotation=Dang! I've lost my monocle again!

[1483]
Annotation=What is that? I can't see a thing!

[1484]
Annotation=All I want is my monocle.

[1485]
Annotation="Oh, there it is. Thanks."

[1486]
Annotation="Ah, that'll work. Thanks."

[1487]
Annotation=No thanks. I already have a perfectly good monocle.

[1488]
Annotation=No thanks.

[1489]
Annotation=I have all the paper I need.

[1490]
Annotation=Of course it is.

[1491]
Annotation=I made it.

[1492]
Annotation=What's this? A map?

[1493]
Annotation=Hmmm...

[1494]
Annotation="Almost, but a critical part is still missing."

[1495]
Annotation=Come back when you have the whole thing.

[1496]
Annotation=Maybe I can help you then.

[1497]
Annotation=Looks like only part of a map.

[1498]
Annotation=I can't make anything out of this.

[1499]
Annotation=It's incomplete.

[1500]
Annotation=Got any more of this?

[1501]
Annotation=Hmmm...

[1502]
Annotation=Still not enough.

[1503]
Annotation=Who's there?

[1504]
Annotation=I can't see anything without my monocle.

[1505]
Annotation=Hmmm...

[1506]
Annotation=Very interesting...

[1507]
Annotation=I'll do it for you if you'll run an errand for me.

[1508]
Annotation=Go to the International House of Mojo and ask the fortune teller if my love potion's ready.

[1509]
Annotation=I'll try to have this done for you when you come back.

[1510]
Annotation=Yep.

[1511]
Annotation=Uh-huh.

[1512]
Annotation=Thanks.

[1513]
Annotation=I like it too.

[1514]
Annotation=Drew it myself.

[1515]
Annotation="Not for sale, though."

[1516]
Annotation="Yeah, me too."

[1517]
Annotation=Oh no.

[1518]
Annotation="Aw, shoot."

[1519]
Annotation=I bet my mom would help me find it...

[1520]
Annotation=...if she were alive.

[1521]
Annotation=For crying out loud.

[1522]
Annotation=I hope it didn't roll onto the floor...

[1523]
Annotation=Nobody move!

[1524]
Annotation=I can't believe somebody would STEAL it...

[1525]
Annotation="I'd go for help, but I'm afraid to walk around like this."

[1526]
Annotation=I'm stuck here forever!

[1527]
Annotation=I'm going to starve to death in here!

[1528]
Annotation=Where is that thing?

[1529]
Annotation="I'm going to die hungry, blind, and alone."

[1530]
Annotation=Why me?

[1531]
Annotation=I never hurt anyone.

[1532]
Annotation=Rats!

[1533]
Annotation=This stinks.

[1534]
Annotation=If I don't find it soon I'm going to lose all the monocle-grabbing muscles in my eye.

[1535]
Annotation=Here monocle. Here boy.

[1536]
Annotation=Crud.

[1537]
Annotation=I swear I put it right here.

[1538]
Annotation=I hope I didn't lose it.

[1539]
Annotation=I'll never be able to afford a new one.

[1540]
Annotation=How am I supposed to work?

[1541]
Annotation=Dang.

[1542]
Annotation=I'm such a dope.

[1543]
Annotation=Can't I do anything right?

[1544]
Annotation=Shoot.

[1545]
Annotation="Oh, hello Mr. Brush."

[1546]
Annotation=Yes?

[1547]
Annotation=Lucasfilm Games Hint Line.

[1548]
Annotation=Chester speaking.

[1549]
Annotation="Look, there are only two ways out of the room you're in."

[1550]
Annotation="Figure it out, knucklehead."

[1551]
Annotation="I told you, just walk off the edge of the screen."

[1552]
Annotation=How hard could that be?

[1553]
Annotation=It's been out for some time now.

[1554]
Annotation="Where have you been, playing some frustrating graphic adventure?"

[1555]
Annotation=I'm tired of hearing about that damn stump.

[1556]
Annotation=Do you have any idea how many calls I get a DAY about that?

[1557]
Annotation=Don't ask me about it again.

[1558]
Annotation="What are you, a pervert?"

[1559]
Annotation=What's wrong with you?

[1560]
Annotation="Hey, I just work here."

[1561]
Annotation=I'm fed up with stupid questions like that.

[1562]
Annotation="It's a surprise, OK?"

[1563]
Annotation=Seventy-five cents a minute.

[1564]
Annotation=You can ask your computer to work out the math for you.

[1565]
Annotation="Yeah, sure."

[1566]
Annotation=(Cheap sexual innuendo.)

[1567]
Annotation=It's alright.

[1568]
Annotation=Like the music?

[1569]
Annotation=Not in months.

[1570]
Annotation=Nyah.  I'm fine.

[1571]
Annotation="Oh, yeah."

[1572]
Annotation=Pretty good turn out.

[1573]
Annotation="Same old, same old."

[1574]
Annotation="Some party, eh?"

[1575]
Annotation=Try the fish?

[1576]
Annotation=Where'd you get the costume?

[1577]
Annotation=(Mindless retort.)

[1578]
Annotation="Yeah, well.  You know."

[1579]
Annotation=Yeah.

[1580]
Annotation=Yeah.  Almost choked on a bone.

[1581]
Annotation=Yeah.  Last week.

[1582]
Annotation=Yep.

[1583]
Annotation=Yep.

[1584]
Annotation="Ah, I wore it last year."

[1585]
Annotation=Blah BLAH blah...

[1586]
Annotation=BLAH blah blah...

[1587]
Annotation=Gotta get the recipe for that fish.

[1588]
Annotation=Hear the one about the Polar Bear with the hairlip?

[1589]
Annotation=Heard any new jokes?

[1590]
Annotation=How's work?

[1591]
Annotation=Can I get you a refill?

[1592]
Annotation=So where are all the chicks?

[1593]
Annotation="What are you, nuts?"

[1594]
Annotation=Sigh.

[1595]
Annotation=I'll drink to that.

[1596]
Annotation=Then again...

[1597]
Annotation="...in these costumes, who can tell?"

[1598]
Annotation=But what can we do about it?

[1599]
Annotation=Ask?

[1600]
Annotation="Sorry, no returns."

[1601]
Annotation="No, thank you."

[1602]
Annotation=You can pick up your costume anytime.

[1603]
Annotation=Hope you're enjoying your costume.

[1604]
Annotation=Our costumes are all gone or on reserve.

[1605]
Annotation=I hear there're invitations available in the gambling alley on Phatt Island.

[1606]
Annotation=One reserved costume per invitation.

[1607]
Annotation=Sorry.

[1608]
Annotation=Try us after Mardi Gras.

[1609]
Annotation=Or get an invitation at the casino on Phatt Island.

[1610]
Annotation="Look.  If you don't have a reservation, you don't have a costume."

[1611]
Annotation="I said, I'm all out."

[1612]
Annotation="I told you, we don't have any more costumes."

[1613]
Annotation=Can't you see I'm busy?

[1614]
Annotation="Sorry, can't help you."

[1615]
Annotation=Next time make a reservation.

[1616]
Annotation=I don't have a costume for you.

[1617]
Annotation=They're all reserved and waiting to be picked up.

[1618]
Annotation=I'm the only costume shop in a five-island radius.

[1619]
Annotation="And besides, everybody who's anybody is going to the big Mardi Gras celebration at Governor Marley's mansion."

[1620]
Annotation="Ah, you have a costume on reserve!"

[1621]
Annotation="Well, that's a different story!"

[1622]
Annotation=Let's see...

[1623]
Annotation=Your costume is right over here...

[1624]
Annotation="Walk this way, please."

[1625]
Annotation="Well, here it is."

[1626]
Annotation=You'll surely be the talk of the party in this.

[1627]
Annotation="Well, have fun and enjoy your costume."

[1628]
Annotation="Sorry, that costume's rented."

[1629]
Annotation=Leave me alone.  I saw that already.

[1630]
Annotation=Let's go!

[2055]
Annotation=I guess that's supposed to make up for everything?

[2056]
Annotation="Nice try, but I think you're too late."

[2057]
Annotation="Decide to act civilized for a change, eh?"

[2058]
Annotation="Oh, so now you're a good guy?"

[2059]
Annotation=You should have thought of that sooner.

[2060]
Annotation=Do you really think you can get on my good side now?

[2061]
Annotation=So much for a pleasant attitude.

[2062]
Annotation=And here I thought you were becoming a decent guy.

[2063]
Annotation="Ooooh, it's going to be that way, is it?"

[2064]
Annotation=There goes any hope for a pleasant conversation.

[2065]
Annotation=This is getting ugly.

[2066]
Annotation=I should have known you weren't sincere.

[2067]
Annotation=You're getting warmer...

[2068]
Annotation="Well, that's not the MOST stupid thing you've ever said."

[2069]
Annotation=That's a LITTLE better...

[2070]
Annotation=Hmmm...  keep going.

[2071]
Annotation=Close.  You're getting close.

[2072]
Annotation=Pathetic.

[2073]
Annotation=Do you really expect me to fall for that?

[2074]
Annotation="Oh, please."

[2075]
Annotation=Is that supposed to make me swoon?

[2076]
Annotation="Yeah, right."

[2077]
Annotation="Give me a break, will ya?"

[2078]
Annotation=Uh-huh.  Sure.

[2079]
Annotation=What book did you steal that out of?

[2080]
Annotation=You've been watching too much daytime television.

[2081]
Annotation="Oh, gag me."

[2082]
Annotation="That may work on other women, but not me."

[2083]
Annotation="Really, I'm touched"

[2084]
Annotation=...NOT!

[2085]
Annotation=That's sweet.

[2086]
Annotation=Now scram.

[2087]
Annotation=What a line!

[2088]
Annotation=I can't believe it--you're even more of a weenie than before.

[2089]
Annotation=You're going to have to try a little harder than that.

[2090]
Annotation=I'm warning you--you're getting on my nerves.

[2091]
Annotation="OK, you're really pushing it now, buddy."

[2092]
Annotation=You're this close to getting a sock in the jaw.

[2093]
Annotation=One more crack like that and you'll be bouncing down those stairs.

[2094]
Annotation="You're on the verge of hospitalization, Guy."

[2095]
Annotation=I see you're charming as ever.

[2096]
Annotation=Now that wasn't very pleasant.

[2097]
Annotation=Maybe you'd better leave.

[2098]
Annotation=I can't believe I actually thought I missed you.

[2099]
Annotation="This is beneath even you, Guybrush."

[2100]
Annotation="You've got a lot of nerve, coming in here and saying that."

[2101]
Annotation=I oughtta just punch you out.

[2102]
Annotation=One thing's for sure--you haven't gotten any better at talking to women.

[2103]
Annotation=I hope that was a joke.

[2104]
Annotation=Same old Guybrush.

[2105]
Annotation=Can't you take a hint?

[2106]
Annotation="Sorry, Threep.  I don't play those games anymore."

[2107]
Annotation=Uh-huh.

[2108]
Annotation="Yeah, right."

[2109]
Annotation="You know, I have work to do..."

[2110]
Annotation="Yeah, yeah, yeah."

[2111]
Annotation=Give me a break.

[2112]
Annotation=Spare me.

[2113]
Annotation=Go tell it to your mother.

[2114]
Annotation="Give it up, Brush."

[2115]
Annotation="Yeah, but even fish have standards."

[2116]
Annotation=Good riddance.

[2117]
Annotation=Finally!

[2118]
Annotation="Well, thanks for stopping by and ruining my day."

[2119]
Annotation=Don't bother my guests on the way out.

[2120]
Annotation=Wish I could say it's been nice.

[2121]
Annotation=You want to try telling me what REALLY happened?

[2122]
Annotation=Horse hockey.

[2123]
Annotation=You honestly expect me to believe you were disintegrated in acid.

[2124]
Annotation="And yet here you are telling me all about it, looking very integrated indeed."

[2125]
Annotation=Great Scott!

[2126]
Annotation=That came from the direction of Dinky Island!

[2127]
Annotation=That idiot must be messing with my grandfather's treasure!

[2128]
Annotation=I'd better get over there.

[2129]
Annotation="Well, well, well."

[2130]
Annotation=Guybrush Threepwood.

[2131]
Annotation=You do turn up in the strangest places.

[2132]
Annotation=How did you get into this mess?

[2133]
Annotation="That's OK, I've got time."

[2134]
Annotation=Anything to shut you up.

[2135]
Annotation=That has to have been the longest story I've ever heard.

[2136]
Annotation="Oh, dear."

[2137]
Annotation=BLAH blah blah...

[2138]
Annotation=Do you mean `Papier-M?ch?'

[2139]
Annotation="No, I don't imagine that it's very expensive at all."

[2140]
Annotation=I never scrimp when it comes to the holidays.

[2141]
Annotation=Parties and balls are my life.

[2142]
Annotation="Making gay is the only purpose I can find in my wretched, well-to-do life."

[2143]
Annotation=Thanks.

[2144]
Annotation=But you say my costume looks cheap.

[2145]
Annotation=That's not what you said before.

[2146]
Annotation=Can't we just drop the subject?

[2147]
Annotation="Yes, thanks."

[2148]
Annotation=Nope.

[2149]
Annotation=I'm sure I don't know.

[2150]
Annotation="Some party, eh?"

[2151]
Annotation=Try the fish?

[2152]
Annotation=Hear the one about the Polar Bear with the hairlip?

[2153]
Annotation="Yeah, well.  You know."

[2154]
Annotation=How's work?

[2155]
Annotation=Like the music?

[2156]
Annotation=Where'd you get the costume?

[2157]
Annotation=Can I get you a refill?

[2158]
Annotation=Pretty good turn out.

[2159]
Annotation=Heard any new jokes?

[2160]
Annotation=Gotta get the recipe for that fish.

[2161]
Annotation=(Cheap sexual innuendo.)

[2162]
Annotation=Blah BLAH blah...

[2163]
Annotation=Yep.

[2164]
Annotation=Yeah.  Almost choked on a bone.

[2165]
Annotation=Yeah.  Last week.

[2166]
Annotation=Yeah.

[2167]
Annotation="Same old, same old."

[2168]
Annotation=It's alright.

[2169]
Annotation="Ah, I wore it last year."

[2170]
Annotation=Nyah.  I'm fine.

[2171]
Annotation=Yep.

[2172]
Annotation=Not in months.

[2173]
Annotation="Oh, yeah."

[2174]
Annotation=(Mindless retort.)

[2175]
Annotation=That's a good idea.

[2176]
Annotation="While you're at it, why don't you show me everything you have in your pockets?"

[2177]
Annotation="Oh, look out for that rake."

[2178]
Annotation=Leave me alone.

[2179]
Annotation=I'm busy.

[2180]
Annotation="What's the matter there, Guybrush?"

[2181]
Annotation=You'd better not touch that dog!

[2182]
Annotation=I'm warning you--he bites!

[2183]
Annotation=I was talking to the dog.

[2184]
Annotation=Who are you?

[2185]
Annotation="Yeah, I don't get it either."

[2186]
Annotation=It's not much of a name if you ask me.

[2187]
Annotation=She says it's cause he's dumb and helpless and keeps getting in the way.

[2188]
Annotation=But he sure can sniff out the Governor's possessions.

[2189]
Annotation=Maybe you should empty your pockets.

[2190]
Annotation=I was just about to suggest the very same thing.

[2191]
Annotation="But first, why don't you empty your pockets?"

[2192]
Annotation="Sure, sure, loverboy."

[2193]
Annotation=I'll just take you right up to see her.

[2194]
Annotation=But let's just see what you have in your pockets.

[2195]
Annotation=No thanks.  It's not on my color wheel.

[2196]
Annotation="Governor, I caught one of your party guests making off with your grandfather's map."

[2197]
Annotation=Maybe I should go rake the back forty.

[2198]
Annotation="In here, Guybrush!"

[2199]
Annotation=What are YOU looking at?

[2200]
Annotation=We're performing.

[2201]
Annotation=That's what we do for a living now.

[2202]
Annotation=`The Sacking Lunch.`

[2203]
Annotation=It was quite lucrative.

[2204]
Annotation="Aside from the obvious reason, we had inside information that Drinky was in fact the resting place of the legendary treasure of..."

[2205]
Annotation=Big Whoop!

[2206]
Annotation=We sank the money into one of those new-fangled glass-bottomed boats.

[2207]
Annotation=...and search for a place called Drinky Island in our spare time.

[2208]
Annotation="Well, I hope your luck is better than ours."

[2209]
Annotation=Seems the salesman didn't have any glass for the bottom...

[2210]
Annotation=...so he just left a gaping hole there.

[2211]
Annotation=We ended up stranded on a tiny desert island.

[2212]
Annotation=Not exactly.

[2213]
Annotation=We're getting to that.

[2214]
Annotation="Right, right."

[2215]
Annotation=Yes.

[2216]
Annotation="We call him `Muenster Monster,` because of his insatiable passion for cheese."

[2217]
Annotation="Oh, good."

[2218]
Annotation=But...

[2219]
Annotation=We're afraid to come down.

[2220]
Annotation="What's the word for it, Frank?"

[2221]
Annotation="Say what you will, we're not coming down."

[2222]
Annotation="Hey, leave that alone."

[2223]
Annotation=Well...

[2224]
Annotation=...no.

[2225]
Annotation=I guess not.

[2226]
Annotation=No.

[2227]
Annotation=No.

[2228]
Annotation=No.

[2229]
Annotation=No.

[2230]
Annotation=No.

[2231]
Annotation=No.

[2232]
Annotation=No.

[2233]
Annotation=No.

[2234]
Annotation=No.

[2235]
Annotation=No.

[2236]
Annotation=No.

[2237]
Annotation=No.

[2238]
Annotation=No.

[2239]
Annotation=Oh...

[2240]
Annotation=...all right.

[2241]
Annotation=No.

[2242]
Annotation=No.

[2243]
Annotation=No.

[2244]
Annotation=Muenster Monster!

[2245]
Annotation=Go get help!

[2246]
Annotation="When he lost the leg, Frank was brilliantly showing the inseparability of the path man walks..."

[2247]
Annotation=...from the food chain.

[2248]
Annotation=He's back.

[2249]
Annotation=Oh really?

[2250]
Annotation=He must have finally got that nasty letter I wrote.

[2251]
Annotation="Look, Guybrush..."

[2252]
Annotation=Besides the fact that we'd all rather die than hear that story again...

[2253]
Annotation=...there's another reason you shouldn't go spreading that story around.

[2254]
Annotation=A two-bit thug!

[2255]
Annotation="Well, we would..."

[2256]
Annotation=The sailing embargo has all of us pirates landlocked.

[2257]
Annotation=We can't go about our business.

[2258]
Annotation=But it's a HUGE tax that no captain on this island can afford.

[2259]
Annotation=That fool Largo doesn't know when to stop.

[2260]
Annotation=He can't take more from us than we have!

[2261]
Annotation=You'll need to go to the far side of the island...

[2262]
Annotation=And there you'll meet a man named...

[2263]
Annotation=...Captain Dread!

[2264]
Annotation="Of course, he can't take you anywhere until Largo lifts his sailing embargo."

[2265]
Annotation=The Largo Embargo!

[2266]
Annotation="The lodging's too expensive, and Largo's quite a pest."

[2267]
Annotation=But the thing I like about Scabb is what it hasn't got:

[2268]
Annotation=No mayor or police force and no jail in which to rot.

[2269]
Annotation="Oh, all right..."

[2270]
Annotation="Well, I'd rather be a pirate on Scabb... Than a scab on a pirate."

[2271]
Annotation="And if you'll listen to me gab, I'll tell you why I admire it."

[2272]
Annotation="Oh, the people aren't too friendly. And the weather's not the best."

[2273]
Annotation="The lodging's too expensive, and Largo was quite a pest."

[2274]
Annotation=It's the stuffing for under my eyepatch.

[2275]
Annotation="We're pirates, Guybrush, not Girl Scouts."

[2276]
Annotation="OK, here's one about a pirate, his parrot, and a tragic day at sea..."

[2277]
Annotation="Sorry, Bart."

[2278]
Annotation=Big Whoop?

[2279]
Annotation="Then, why'd you come here?"

[2280]
Annotation=There's no treasure on Scabb Island!

[2281]
Annotation=Or you'll have died trying.

[2282]
Annotation=I think I know how he must have felt.

[2283]
Annotation=Don't you have any NEW stories?

[2284]
Annotation=Looks like Guybrush is still carrying a torch for the Governor.

[2285]
Annotation="Sorry, Mr. Sensitive."

[2286]
Annotation=The only other songs I know are dirty ones about Governor Marley.

[2287]
Annotation="Oh, no. Not this story again!"

[2288]
Annotation="OK, that's enough."

[2289]
Annotation=508!

[2290]
Annotation="Oh, I beg to differ with you:"

[2291]
Annotation=I'M the best fisherman in these isles.

[2292]
Annotation="Yeah, RIGHT."

[2293]
Annotation="If you fish as poorly as you lie, you don't even deserve to be talking to me."

[2294]
Annotation="I'm the best fisherman in these isles, you know."

[2295]
Annotation="Oh, yeah?"

[2296]
Annotation=What?

[2297]
Annotation=The pike I catch make Pike's Peak look like an anthill.

[2298]
Annotation=That's why I'm known as `The Blowfish.`

[2299]
Annotation=What's THAT supposed to mean?

[2300]
Annotation=...

[2301]
Annotation="Listen bait-for-brains, I'm the best around and that's that."

[2302]
Annotation="Perhaps you'd like to make a small WAGER, eh, Mr. Fisherman?"

[2303]
Annotation=I think you're just trying to get your hands on my fishing pole.

[2304]
Annotation=Do you fish?

[2305]
Annotation=Hah!

[2306]
Annotation="I think so, too."

[2307]
Annotation="Well, I was just thinking about a small WAGER."

[2308]
Annotation=Are you a betting man?

[2309]
Annotation=Let me tell you what I had in mind first.

[2310]
Annotation=Pity.

[2311]
Annotation=It would have been...

[2312]
Annotation=...interesting.

[2313]
Annotation=If you can catch a bigger fish than I can...

[2314]
Annotation=...I'll GIVE you my prize-winning fishing pole.

[2315]
Annotation=If I catch a bigger fish than YOU...

[2316]
Annotation=...you have to eat it.

[2317]
Annotation=RAW.

[2318]
Annotation=Improvise.  I'm sure you'll think of something.

[2319]
Annotation="Plain, cold, and with the head still on it."

[2320]
Annotation=What do you say?

[2321]
Annotation=No.

[2322]
Annotation=Exactly.

[2323]
Annotation=ahem

[2324]
Annotation=What?

[2325]
Annotation="Like I say, you'd have to eat a raw fish."

[2326]
Annotation="Hey, don't touch that!"

[2327]
Annotation=It's precisely balanced for maximum hydrophonic fibrilation.

[2328]
Annotation=Great!

[2329]
Annotation=I am really looking forward to making you eat my catch.

[2330]
Annotation="What with all the sewage from Governor Phatt's mansion, the fish are usually pretty gross."

[2331]
Annotation="I never eat mine, just sell them to restaurants."

[2332]
Annotation="Best get fishing, buddy."

[2333]
Annotation=Heh heh heh.

[2334]
Annotation=Catch ya later.

[2335]
Annotation=<chuckle>

[2336]
Annotation=OK.

[2337]
Annotation=Let me know if you change your mind about being a wimp.

[2338]
Annotation=OK.

[2339]
Annotation=I'll be right here.

[2340]
Annotation=Thanks.

[2341]
Annotation='--er--

[2342]
Annotation=It's almost as big as the leviathan I just hauled in.

[2343]
Annotation=Errr...

[2344]
Annotation="Yeah, you're right, it was just a fish story."

[2345]
Annotation=I guess you win.

[2346]
Annotation="Here, take the pole."

[2347]
Annotation=Wow!

[2348]
Annotation=This is the biggest--

[2349]
Annotation="Say, thanks."

[2350]
Annotation=I've been looking for a copy of this book to help me identify some of the stranger looking fish I've caught.

[2351]
Annotation=Can't you see I'm busy?

[2352]
Annotation="Yeah, but nothing gross enough to make you eat yet."

[2353]
Annotation=(Heh heh heh)

[2354]
Annotation="Oh, hi."

[2355]
Annotation=Given any more thought to that little wager?

[2356]
Annotation="I said, hands off my fishing rod."

[2357]
Annotation=Are you kidding?

[2358]
Annotation=I reached my limit hours ago!

[2359]
Annotation=More than I could ever eat!

[2360]
Annotation="Oh, you are, are you?"

[2361]
Annotation="You're a game warden, eh?"

[2362]
Annotation=Let's see a badge or something.

[2363]
Annotation=Then why don't you pipe down?

[2364]
Annotation=Guybrush Threepwood.

[2365]
Annotation=It's been a long time since you last came to see me.

[2366]
Annotation="Back again, Mr. Threepwood?"

[2367]
Annotation="Oh, OK."

[2368]
Annotation="Tell him I said to enjoy, but to be careful."

[2369]
Annotation=It's powerful stuff.

[2370]
Annotation=Wouldn't want that little guy getting hurt--

[2371]
Annotation=Rules are rules.

[2372]
Annotation=I can't make you any of that potion without some ash from the subject's remains.

[2373]
Annotation=That's one of my most powerful potions.

[2374]
Annotation=But I only give it out in cases of serious need.

[2375]
Annotation=Brings the dead back to life.

[2376]
Annotation=There are some complications.

[2377]
Annotation="It only works on ashes, and the resurrection is only temporary."

[2378]
Annotation="Plus, you need to bring me a sample of the subject's ashes before I can mix you up a batch."

[2379]
Annotation="Ah, we often forget those who help us most."

[2380]
Annotation=It was I who told you how to do away with LeChuck.

[2381]
Annotation=I told you where to find the voodoo antiroot...

[2382]
Annotation=...and how to turn it into the powerful ghost-dissolving potion you needed.

[2383]
Annotation="Sorry, no returns on personalized voodoo products."

[2384]
Annotation=If it's not working I suggest you get closer to your subject.

[2385]
Annotation=...something of the Head...

[2386]
Annotation=...something of the Body...

[2387]
Annotation=...and something of the Dead.

[2388]
Annotation="For the Thread, I need a piece of Largo's clothing."

[2389]
Annotation=And a lock of hair will do for the Head.

[2390]
Annotation="Bring me a sample of fluid from his Body,"

[2391]
Annotation=And from his Dead relatives you must acquire some remnant of a corpse.

[2392]
Annotation=Here--take this shopping list.

[2393]
Annotation=I've tried.

[2394]
Annotation=Do you have any of those ingredients with you?

[2395]
Annotation=My most powerful magic lies in voodoo dolls.

[2396]
Annotation="But to make an effective doll I need some items from Largo's person, and no one's brave enough to go get them for me."

[2397]
Annotation=Are you willing to help me make one?

[2398]
Annotation=To make it work you need to bring me some personal artifacts of the victim.

[2399]
Annotation=One from each of the four basic voodoo groups:

[2400]
Annotation=Something of the Thread...

[2401]
Annotation=He's a weak little man who bullies this whole island around.

[2402]
Annotation=Most people are afraid of him because he was once LeChuck's right-hand man.

[2403]
Annotation=True evil can never be destroyed completely.

[2404]
Annotation=You will see.

[2405]
Annotation=Very good.  Many hexes this week.

[2406]
Annotation=Saved many people from the evil eye.

[2407]
Annotation="Made many pieces of eight, although Largo took most of them."

[2408]
Annotation="I see a hard road for you, Guybrush."

[2409]
Annotation="Things didn't get easy for you when you defeated LeChuck, did they?"

[2410]
Annotation=People only wanted more.

[2411]
Annotation=You had to keep proving yourself over and over.

[2412]
Annotation=The pressure kept mounting until you lost it all--

[2413]
Annotation=Your fame... your fortune...

[2414]
Annotation=...the one you love.

[2415]
Annotation=Wait!

[2416]
Annotation=I just felt a sudden disturbance in the Force...

[2417]
Annotation="As if a tiny, tiny voice just called out in fear..."

[2418]
Annotation=...and then hastily scratched a message in a table.

[2419]
Annotation="I think Wally's in trouble, and I think LeChuck has something to do with it!"

[2420]
Annotation=It'll be much better once you use that voodoo doll on Largo!

[2421]
Annotation="Yeah, it worked pretty well, didn't it?"

[2422]
Annotation=I still have the touch.

[2423]
Annotation=I've got the real stuff back here.

[2424]
Annotation=Yes?

[2425]
Annotation="Hey, I got a license!"

[2426]
Annotation=So be it.

[2427]
Annotation="Now, go!"

[2428]
Annotation=Bring them to me.

[2429]
Annotation="Now, there's only one small problem..."

[2430]
Annotation=I forgot the recipe.

[2431]
Annotation=It's been a long time.

[2432]
Annotation=I don't have that cookbook anymore.

[2433]
Annotation=Good!

[2434]
Annotation=How many crab scalps does it say to use?

[2435]
Annotation=Good.

[2436]
Annotation=That's just what I thought when I whipped up this experimental batch.

[2437]
Annotation="Remember, just a dab'll do ya."

[2438]
Annotation="I told you, I don't have that cookbook anymore."

[2439]
Annotation="I've given you all the help I can, for now."

[2440]
Annotation=The rest is up to you.

[2441]
Annotation=Have you brought me the ingredients?

[2442]
Annotation=Have you brought me the final ingredient?

[2443]
Annotation=Have you brought me any more ingredients?

[2444]
Annotation=Hmmm...  Not quite a part of his head...

[2445]
Annotation=But maybe I can get some scalp fragments from it.

[2446]
Annotation=Excellent.

[2447]
Annotation=Good.

[2448]
Annotation=You may keep the paper.

[2449]
Annotation=Perfect.

[2450]
Annotation="Yes, that will work."

[2451]
Annotation=Do you have the final ingredient?

[2452]
Annotation=Have you brought me any other ingredients?

[2453]
Annotation=Just like the list says...

[2454]
Annotation=Something from his body...

[2455]
Annotation=Something from his clothes...

[2456]
Annotation=Some of his bodily fluids...

[2457]
Annotation=Something from his ancestors...

[2458]
Annotation=...that's all we need to complete the doll.

[2459]
Annotation=...that's all.

[2460]
Annotation=At last!

[2461]
Annotation=This ought to be good.

[2462]
Annotation=Two!  Four!  Six!  Eight!

[2463]
Annotation=Who do we assassinate?

[2464]
Annotation=Largo!  Largo!  Yeah!

[2465]
Annotation=One more thing...

[2466]
Annotation=Some of the ingredients were not the optimum specimens.

[2467]
Annotation="It should still work, but it will have a limited range."

[2468]
Annotation=You will have to get close to Largo.

[2469]
Annotation=Now I can make a voodoo doll to be reckoned with!

[2470]
Annotation=Very close.

[2471]
Annotation=Let me get my juju bag.

[2472]
Annotation=And now for the ingredients...

[2473]
Annotation=A dandruff flake from Largo's head!

[2474]
Annotation=A single piece of Largo's thread!

[2475]
Annotation=A drop of fluid from his body!

[2476]
Annotation=A single chip off the bone of the dead!

[2477]
Annotation="And finally, some miscellaneous voodoo herbs and seasonings, including monosodium glutamate."

[2478]
Annotation="I'm afraid it's true, Guybrush."

[2479]
Annotation=Yes.

[2480]
Annotation=And I don't think that's going to make him any more pleasant to deal with.

[2481]
Annotation=Yes.

[2482]
Annotation=Undoubtedly.

[2483]
Annotation="If they have any animated tissue, they can reanimate his whole body."

[2484]
Annotation="Not his body, Guybrush."

[2485]
Annotation=You destroyed his spirit form.

[2486]
Annotation=His body was safely buried far away.

[2487]
Annotation=Rotten?

[2488]
Annotation=Partially decomposed?

[2489]
Annotation=You're already doing all that you can.

[2490]
Annotation=It contains the secret to another world.

[2491]
Annotation=Find that world and you'll be able to escape LeChuck forever.

[2492]
Annotation=Take this book.

[2493]
Annotation=I checked it out at the Phatt City Library.

[2494]
Annotation=I foresaw your need.

[2495]
Annotation="I used your name when I checked it out, so be sure and return it when you're through reading."

[2496]
Annotation=There is no place to hide.

[2497]
Annotation=The overdue fines in Phatt City are pretty steep.

[2498]
Annotation=But there is a way out.

[2499]
Annotation=You're doing it right now.

[2500]
Annotation=Hunting for Big Whoop.

[2501]
Annotation=Big Whoop isn't just a treasure.

[2502]
Annotation=He has magic just as strong as mine.

[2503]
Annotation=Nothing I could give you would protect you.

[2504]
Annotation="You must try not to lose hope, Guybrush."

[2505]
Annotation=There is a way out.

[2506]
Annotation="Guybrush, you don't have any time to waste!"

[2507]
Annotation=I can offer you no more help.

[2508]
Annotation=Your destiny is in your own hands now.

[2509]
Annotation=Hey!  That's just a display model!

[2510]
Annotation=Not now!

[2511]
Annotation=Can't you see there's an emergency happening here?

[2512]
Annotation=Do we know you?

[2513]
Annotation=What is it?

[2514]
Annotation=How nice for you.

[2515]
Annotation="Sure, you are."

[2516]
Annotation="Why did you wake us up, Gorbush?"

[2517]
Annotation=Map?

[2518]
Annotation=Err...

[2519]
Annotation=I don't know what you're talking about.

[2520]
Annotation=Fine.

[2521]
Annotation="What is it this time, Graybrash?"

[2522]
Annotation="What is it this time, Gooblush?"

[2523]
Annotation="What is it this time, Flybrunch?"

[2524]
Annotation="What is it this time, Frygoosh?"

[2525]
Annotation=That's right.

[2526]
Annotation=Performing.

[2527]
Annotation="You see, after our circus failed, we started a pirate catering business on nearby Phatt Island."

[2528]
Annotation="Boy, did we ever want to get there!"

[2529]
Annotation="The governor of the island made us an offer we, er..."

[2530]
Annotation=...couldn't refuse.

[2531]
Annotation=So we sold him the business.

[2532]
Annotation=We wanted to take passengers on sight-seeing trips...

[2533]
Annotation=I'm getting to that.

[2534]
Annotation=We're getting to that.

[2535]
Annotation=He told us that all the world is a stage and that we are merely players.

[2536]
Annotation="So, we became performance artists."

[2537]
Annotation=In our current work we portray man's response to global environmental issues of a changing world.

[2538]
Annotation="You see, we got a bit of a raw deal on the boat."

[2539]
Annotation="By the time we noticed, we were taking on water fast!"

[2540]
Annotation="We met a philosopher on the island, and he told us something which changed our lives."

[2541]
Annotation=Ah...

[2542]
Annotation=...to show the precarious nature of the situation.

[2543]
Annotation=...so to speak.

[2544]
Annotation=OK.

[2545]
Annotation=Great.

[2546]
Annotation=Here's some money for the polish.

[2547]
Annotation=We can scarcely contain our anticipation.

[2548]
Annotation=You do?

[2549]
Annotation=Err...

[2550]
Annotation=Hmm...

[2551]
Annotation="All right, you got us."

[2552]
Annotation=We're really up here because...

[2553]
Annotation=...well...

[2554]
Annotation=Err...

[2555]
Annotation=Ahh...

[2556]
Annotation=It's the opposite of acrophobia.

[2557]
Annotation=Something like `orcaphobia.`

[2558]
Annotation=Thanks!

[2559]
Annotation=Here's a piece of eight for your trouble.

[2560]
Annotation="I'd give you a piece of eight, but I'm fresh out."

[2561]
Annotation=Aaaiiieee!!!

[2562]
Annotation=My leg!

[2563]
Annotation=Help!

[2564]
Annotation=Someone get a doctor!

[2565]
Annotation="You know, this leg is looking sort of dingy."

[2566]
Annotation=Would you get some polish over at the woodsmith's and polish it for me?

[2567]
Annotation=Thanks.

[2568]
Annotation=Here's some money for the polish.

[2569]
Annotation=It happened during a performance.

[2570]
Annotation=The symbolism of the cheese was essential.

[2571]
Annotation=Hey!

[2572]
Annotation=SHUT UP!

[2573]
Annotation=Hey!

[2574]
Annotation="Put a lid on it, Fred!"

[2575]
Annotation=You want the whole world to know?

[2576]
Annotation=All right!

[2577]
Annotation=What have you got left?

[2578]
Annotation=I'd like the money.

[2579]
Annotation=Yeah.

[2580]
Annotation=I think that's enough for me today.

[2581]
Annotation="Excuse me, pal."

[2653]
Annotation=Thanks.

[2654]
Annotation="Well, Mr.--"

[2655]
Annotation="'--oh, excuse me."

[2656]
Annotation="Well, Mr. Threepwood, I can't tell you how pleased I am to have you here as my guest."

[2657]
Annotation=I thought we might talk about a few things.

[2658]
Annotation=I simply wanted to insure that you didn't slip away before we had a chance to meet.

[2659]
Annotation=There's something I'd like to discuss.

[2660]
Annotation="You have an eye for the finer things, Mr. Threepwood."

[2661]
Annotation=Ha ha ha

[2662]
Annotation="Funny you should mention LeChuck, as he's the reason I brought you here."

[2663]
Annotation="Oh, do stay a while."

[2664]
Annotation=We have much to discuss.

[2665]
Annotation=I admit my tastes run to the expensive.

[2666]
Annotation="I am not a patient man, Mr. Threepwood."

[2667]
Annotation="Be careful upon whose toes you tread, Mr. Threepwood."

[2668]
Annotation="Such as your future, Mr. Threepwood."

[2669]
Annotation=And that of the Ghost Pirate LeChuck.

[2670]
Annotation="`Destroying,` is it?"

[2671]
Annotation="Why, you--"

[2672]
Annotation='--excuse me.

[2673]
Annotation="Ah, I see."

[2674]
Annotation="Yes, I've had to indulge in a bit of creative financing."

[2675]
Annotation=But I've just made a deal that will keep the bill collectors out of here for a long time.

[2676]
Annotation="I beg your pardon, did you say something?"

[2677]
Annotation=I'll be selling something which I believe I shall be GLAD to be rid of.

[2678]
Annotation="I'm selling YOU, Mr. Threepwood."

[2679]
Annotation=To the Ghost Pirate LeChuck.

[2680]
Annotation=Perhaps you didn't kill him quite so thoroughly as you imagine.

[2681]
Annotation=He looked perfectly healthy the last time I saw him.

[2682]
Annotation=You'll get your chance.

[2683]
Annotation="You see, he's put a sizeable bounty on your head."

[2684]
Annotation=A bounty I intend to collect.

[2685]
Annotation="I rather think he'll find YOU, Mr. Threepwood."

[2686]
Annotation=You can hide out until LeChuck comes to pick you up.

[2687]
Annotation=Ha ha ha

[2688]
Annotation="Very amusing, Mr. Threepwood."

[2689]
Annotation="Why, you!"

[2690]
Annotation=You can figure it out while you wait in jail for LeChuck to pick you up.

[2691]
Annotation=Take him away!

[2692]
Annotation="Let's get down to why you're here, shall we?"

[2693]
Annotation=I intend to SELL you.

[2694]
Annotation=To the Ghost Pirate LeChuck.

[2695]
Annotation="Why, yes, Miss Bilkfarm, I'd love another case of eclairs."

[2696]
Annotation="Ah, sugarplums..."

[2697]
Annotation=More!  More spaghetti pie!

[2698]
Annotation=Look out for the custard!

[2699]
Annotation=And the winner of the weenie-eating contest is...

[2700]
Annotation=Governor Phatt!

[2701]
Annotation="More sauce on the goose, please."

[2702]
Annotation="Cranberries?  Yes, I love cranberries!"

[2703]
Annotation="Careful with those pitons, or we'll fall into the jelly."

[2704]
Annotation=Now I've got to eat my way out of the sea of tapioca pudding.

[2705]
Annotation="Why, that's the second biggest pound cake I've ever seen!"

[2706]
Annotation="Careful with those snacks, Eugene."

[2707]
Annotation="Yes, my single-handed defeat of the Fudge Brigade WAS rather amazing."

[2708]
Annotation=My kingdom for a peanut butter goat cream truffle!

[2709]
Annotation=...and I promise cheese and chocolate sprinkles in every pot...

[2710]
Annotation=Show me again how to hypnotize a rhino with an all-day sucker.

[2711]
Annotation=When thinking the brain resembles a swiss cheese...

[2712]
Annotation=Just back the truck in.

[2713]
Annotation=Hello?  I'd like a hundred gallons of butterscotch topping please.

[2714]
Annotation="No, you can't have a bite, it's mine."

[2715]
Annotation="Get your own, mother."

[2716]
Annotation=The world is my chocolate Easter egg.

[2717]
Annotation=Maybe you should get a shave while you're at it.

[2718]
Annotation=Ha ha ha ha.

[2719]
Annotation=I said the Governor is not to be disturbed while he's eating.

[2720]
Annotation=Hold it!

[2721]
Annotation=You can't go up there.

[2722]
Annotation="Hey, aren't you supposed to be in jail?"

[2723]
Annotation="Oh, I see."

[2724]
Annotation=The resemblance is uncanny.

[2725]
Annotation=Oh.

[2726]
Annotation=Ha ha.

[2727]
Annotation=That's a good one.

[2728]
Annotation=Walt would have chewed you to bits.

[2729]
Annotation="I'm sorry, but the Governor doesn't want to be disturbed while he's eating."

[2730]
Annotation=Really?

[2731]
Annotation=I'd better check it out.

[2732]
Annotation=Really?

[2733]
Annotation=I'd better fetch the cook!

[2734]
Annotation="Hey, Rich.  I could use a hand with this one."

[2735]
Annotation=Looks like another box of live snakes.

[2736]
Annotation="Well, let's get it on the truck."

[2737]
Annotation="You know, we usually don't deliver out this far..."

[2738]
Annotation=...what a butt.

[2739]
Annotation="Hey, you kids!"

[2740]
Annotation=You're not supposed to be in here!

[2741]
Annotation=I said cut that out!

[2742]
Annotation=Hey!  What's all the racket?

[2743]
Annotation=You again?!

[2744]
Annotation="Oh, there you are."

[2745]
Annotation="Anyway, like I was saying..."

[2746]
Annotation=There you go again!

[2747]
Annotation=Cut that out!

[2748]
Annotation=Aren't you listening to me?

[2749]
Annotation=I'm about to stick that thing in your ear!

[2750]
Annotation=Hey!  Come back here!  I'm not done yet!

[2751]
Annotation=Don't even THINK about going in there!

[2752]
Annotation=Don't mess with the Governor's cans!

[2753]
Annotation=Don't be blowing nothing around here!

[2754]
Annotation=Who do you think you are?

[2755]
Annotation=You better just get out of here!

[2756]
Annotation=No good punk.

[2757]
Annotation="If it's not raccoons, it's teenage vandals!"

[2758]
Annotation=You call that music or something?

[2759]
Annotation=You heard me.  Get lost.

[2760]
Annotation=Transient hooligan.

[2761]
Annotation=Why I oughtta...

[2762]
Annotation=You've got some nerve.

[2763]
Annotation=I don't have time for this.

[2764]
Annotation=Go away boy.  You bother me.

[2765]
Annotation=Beat it!

[2766]
Annotation=I'm going to use this meat cleaver in a second.

[2767]
Annotation=This neighborhood has really gone downhill.

[2768]
Annotation=Get a job!

[2769]
Annotation=Why don't you go down to the dump if you like garbage cans so much?

[2770]
Annotation=Why don't you go join a parade if you like blowing horns so much?

[2771]
Annotation=SCRAM!

[2772]
Annotation=Don't you have anything better to do?

[2773]
Annotation=Kids today!

[2774]
Annotation=Does your mother know where you are?

[2775]
Annotation=I'm sick of looking at you already.

[2776]
Annotation=Bothering innocent people's trash...

[2777]
Annotation=Bothering innocent people with blaring music...

[2778]
Annotation=Why don't you shove off?

[2779]
Annotation=What's the matter?  No parlay Englais?

[2780]
Annotation=I said scram!

[2781]
Annotation=Vammoose!

[2782]
Annotation=Try sticking your head in a cannon if you like loud noises.

[2783]
Annotation="Don't let me catch you hanging around the Governor's party, either."

[2784]
Annotation=Take a hike!

[2785]
Annotation="OK, that's it.  I'm calling the cops!"

[2786]
Annotation=Make yourself scarce.

[2787]
Annotation=You'd better go before I lose my temper.

[2788]
Annotation=I'll beat you like an egg!

[2789]
Annotation="This is a respectable place, hear me?"

[2790]
Annotation=We don't take to your kind here.

[2791]
Annotation=Buzz off!

[2792]
Annotation=Shoo!

[2793]
Annotation="Yeah, I'm talking to you!"

[2794]
Annotation=Amscray!

[2795]
Annotation=I think I hear your mother calling.

[2796]
Annotation=Go get a haircut!

[2797]
Annotation=I'm warning you--I can debone a chicken in fifteen seconds with my bare hands.

[2798]
Annotation="OK, that's it.  No more Mr. Nice Guy."

[2799]
Annotation=This is your last chance--I'm running out of spit.

[2800]
Annotation=Hmpf!

[2801]
Annotation=Punk.

[2802]
Annotation=Let this be a lesson to you.

[2803]
Annotation=You're lucky I have to get back to my fish!

[2804]
Annotation="And, well..."

[2805]
Annotation=...just don't you forget it!

[2806]
Annotation=The nerve...

[2807]
Annotation=Hey!  Kitchen staff only!

[2808]
Annotation=I said kitchen staff only!

[2809]

[2819]
Annotation="Yes, we are."

[2820]
Annotation="We have some information for you, son."

[2821]
Annotation=We came looking for you.

[2822]
Annotation="Ah, so there you are!"

[2823]
Annotation=Your mother and I were very concerned.

[2824]
Annotation=Good.

[2825]
Annotation="Well, come on then, let's go ride the Madly Rotating Buccaneer."

[2826]
Annotation=We're scolding you for running off.

[2827]
Annotation=Your mother and I were very concerned.

[2828]
Annotation="Well, it's not the Screaming Weenie Hut where we told you to meet us."

[2829]
Annotation=The head bone's connected to the...

[2830]

Annotation=The rib bone's connected to the...

[2839]
Annotation=Where have you been?

[2840]
Annotation=Why would we do that?

[2841]
Annotation=We are such loving parents.

[2842]
Annotation="Well, we're going to give it to you in the form of a song."

[2843]
Annotation="Thank you for hunting down your brother like we asked, Chuckie dear."

[2844]
Annotation="I wish you wouldn't run off like that, young man."

[2845]
Annotation=We were worried sick.

[2846]
Annotation=You don't know what kinds of murderers and ne'er do wells might be hanging around a place like this.

[2847]
Annotation="Of course, dear."

[2848]
Annotation=But please be careful.

[2849]
Annotation=Just the same old family you've always had.

[2850]
Annotation="Nothing I say is ever the same, yet it is all said the same way."

[2851]
Annotation=As you wish.

[2852]
Annotation=You will return.

[2853]
Annotation="Money is seldom a treasure, my friend."

[2854]
Annotation=Big Whoop?

[2855]
Annotation=I'm afraid I'm not familiar with that one.

[2856]
Annotation=...and of course there's the treasure of patience...

[2857]
Annotation=Sure beats a Tibetan mountaintop.

[2858]
Annotation=I can go surfing when things are slow.

[2859]
Annotation=Neo-existentialist Cartesian Zen Taoism.

[2860]
Annotation=It's all the rage at cocktail parties this year.

[2861]
Annotation=Well...

[2862]
Annotation="...none, at the moment."

[2863]
Annotation=But as soon as word gets out that a guru such as myself is teaching in a beautiful locale like this...

[2864]
Annotation=...I'll have to beat them off with a stick.

[2865]
Annotation=Just let me know if you want to learn a little philosophy.

[2866]
Annotation=Nope.

[2867]
Annotation=No.

[2868]
Annotation=Nah.

[2869]
Annotation=Not even close.

[2870]
Annotation=Not exactly.

[2871]
Annotation="Think about it some more, and come back when you have an answer."

[2872]
Annotation=Exactly!

[2873]
Annotation="Now, what has this experience taught you?"

[2874]
Annotation="I'm very impressed, it takes most people years to reach this point."

[2875]
Annotation=You have learned all that you can from me.

[2876]
Annotation=Go forth into the world with confidence.

[2877]
Annotation=I won't even charge you a buck.

[2878]
Annotation="Oh, hi."

[2879]
Annotation=I've been waiting for you.

[2880]
Annotation="Our meeting comes at this, the final moment of my existence so far."

[2881]
Annotation=All else has been in anticipation of this event.

[2882]
Annotation="Thank you my son, but I want for nothing."

[2883]
Annotation=I'm teaching philosophy here.

[2884]
Annotation="Alright, what is it?"

[2885]
Annotation="OK, here's a Zen koan for you."

[2886]
Annotation=A philosophical puzzle.

[2887]
Annotation="If a tree falls in the forest, and no one is around to hear it..."

[2888]
Annotation=...what color is the tree?

[2889]
Annotation="There are many treasures here, found and unfound."

[2890]
Annotation="The beauty of the ocean, for example."

[2891]
Annotation="Or the treasure of the past, seen in the rings of trees or the half-remembered cacklings of a parrot..."

[2892]
Annotation="...the treasure of the future, waiting in the seeds of mangoes and the eggs of the platypus..."

[2893]
Annotation="...dreams that bring us messages from afar which we are too simple to understand, and stars that do the same..."

[2894]
Annotation=...and may not riches be found in the words of one who has explored the veiled inner worlds of the self?

[2895]
Annotation="Speaking of which, I am taking on students for a limited time."

[2896]
Annotation=I think you will find that the concept of 'better things' is the frailest of illusions.

[2897]
Annotation=Yours too.

[2898]
Annotation="But see, already the moment passes."

[2899]
Annotation=Now our meeting is nothing more than another note in the grand overture to the next passage.

[2900]
Annotation="The moment has passed, and we face the future."

[2901]
Annotation="Oh, you meant THIS treasure."

[2902]
Annotation=Why didn't you say so?

[2903]
Annotation="You could have come by the shortcut, like I do."

[2904]
Annotation=Don't bug me. I'm busy.

[2905]
Annotation="Sorry, we only have one and it's full."

[2906]
Annotation="Yeah, but that dang Largo eats like thirty."

[2907]
Annotation=Hold it right there!

[2908]
Annotation=That's a private room.

[2909]
Annotation=No going up there.

[2910]
Annotation="I told you, no going up there!"

[2911]
Annotation=Hey!

[2912]
Annotation=How'd old Pegbiter get loose?

[2913]
Annotation=I'd better go catch him...

[2914]
Annotation=...before he catches somebody else.

[2915]
Annotation=Be with you in a second.

[2916]
Annotation=Time is money.

[2917]
Annotation=Save your money. The inn's full.

[2918]
Annotation=Yes?

[2919]
Annotation="No, my name is Kate Capsize."

[2920]
Annotation=You must have me confused with someone else.

[2921]
Annotation=My ID is on my ship.  Wait here while I go and get it.

[2922]
Annotation=Idiots!

[2923]
Annotation=You'll have to excuse me if I don't stick around.

[2924]
Annotation=I've got to find out who FRAMED me!

[2925]
Annotation=Fools!

[2926]
Annotation="Who is this Peepwind character, anyway?"

[2927]
Annotation=They can't keep me locked up!

[2928]
Annotation=I'll figure a way out of here!

[2929]
Annotation=Hey!

[2930]
Annotation=Thanks for letting me out of there!

[2931]
Annotation=Let me know when you're ready to head out.

[2932]
Annotation=I'll be here.

[2933]
Annotation="You'd best figure that out, then come back and let me know."

[2934]
Annotation=I don't need any more money from you.

[2935]
Annotation=I take it you want to charter my ship.

[2936]
Annotation="All right, that's six thousand pieces of eight."

[2937]
Annotation=Thanks!

[2938]
Annotation=You've just chartered yourself a ship!

[2939]
Annotation=I don't recognize this at all.

[2940]
Annotation=You'd better take it to an expert.

[2941]
Annotation="Thanks, I've already got some."

[2942]
Annotation="Thanks, but no thanks."

[2943]
Annotation=I have a treasure guarantee policy with all my charters.

[2944]
Annotation="Since you came back empty-handed, we can go out again, free of charge."

[2945]
Annotation=Just let me know if you want to go.

[2946]
Annotation=Let me know when you're ready to try again.

[2947]
Annotation="Well, congratulations on your find, Guybrush."

[2948]
Annotation=Be sure and tell any friends you might have about Capsize Charters.

[2949]
Annotation=See you around the turnpike.

[2950]
Annotation="If you want to charter my ship, it'll cost you six thousand pieces of eight."

[2951]
Annotation=My fee is 6000 pieces of eight.

[2952]
Annotation=Trying to avoid guys like you.

[2953]
Annotation="Once TOO often, obviously."

[2954]
Annotation=You'll have to wait a lot longer than that to pick ME up.

[2955]
Annotation=I'm surprised anyone calls you at all.

[2956]
Annotation=Hopefully off a cliff.

[2957]
Annotation=`No trespassing.`

[2958]
Annotation=How'd you like a nice Fruit Punch?

[2959]
Annotation=Call me when you can find one.

[2960]
Annotation=Has anyone ever swallowed that line?

[2961]
Annotation="I've seen lobotomies, thanks."

[2962]
Annotation=Preferably long distance.

[2963]
Annotation=Just the part with the knuckles.

[2964]
Annotation=Aren't you a famous jerk?

[2965]
Annotation=How would you like to BE buried treasure?

[2966]
Annotation=I guess I was wrong when I thought you couldn't possibly be as dumb as you look.

[2967]
Annotation="You can go be in your OWN hands, creep."

[2968]
Annotation=What are you looking at?

[2969]
Annotation=Cruises!

[2970]
Annotation=Sightseeing!

[2971]
Annotation=Sunken Galleons!

[2972]
Annotation=Glass-bottom boat!

[2973]
Annotation=Check it out!

[2974]
Annotation=See the world!

[2975]
Annotation=Three-hour tours!

[2976]
Annotation=Last day before I leave for Phatt Island!

[2977]
Annotation=I'm Captain Kate Capsize.

[2978]
Annotation=Like to charter a ship?

[2979]
Annotation="I do weddings, funerals, bar mitzvahs, you name it."

[2980]
Annotation="Yeah, OK."

[2981]
Annotation="Hey, these things cost money."

[2982]
Annotation="OK, show me where you want to go this time."

[2983]
Annotation=Great!

[2984]
Annotation=Not many people want to charter a glass-bottomed boat around here.

[2985]
Annotation="Pretty soon I'm off to Phatt Island to try my luck there, but let's talk turkey first."

[2986]
Annotation="Yeah, and you can't have any of it, so don't ask."

[2987]
Annotation=Yeah?

[2988]
Annotation=When I was first mate on the Limping Limpet we went in search of Big Whoop.

[2989]
Annotation=We'd heard it was buried under a place called Blinky Island.

[2990]
Annotation=Never found the island OR the treasure.

[2991]
Annotation=The captain eventually died of boredom while we were crossing the Sea of Beige Flotsam.

[2992]
Annotation=Hope your luck is better.

[2993]
Annotation=You and everybody else on this island.

[2994]
Annotation="If you need a ship, you know where to find me."

[2995]
Annotation="As I mentioned, my fee is 6000 pieces of eight."

[2996]
Annotation="No, I don't."

[2997]
Annotation="Well, perhaps you'd better get some."

[2998]
Annotation="I guess you'd better find some more, then, huh?"

[2999]
Annotation=You've chartered yourself a ship.

[3000]
Annotation="My name's Kate Capsize, I'll be your Captain."

[3001]
Annotation=Are you ready to leave now?

[3002]
Annotation=Ha ha ha ha ha!

[3003]
Annotation="OK, I'll be here."

[3004]
Annotation=Have you got a course planned or anything?

[3005]
Annotation=Well...

[3006]
Annotation="...I feel kind of sorry for you, so OK."

[3007]
Annotation=Just point it out.

[3008]
Annotation=Very funny.

[3009]
Annotation="Well, here we are."

[3010]
Annotation=What now?

[3011]
Annotation=The guy who writes your lines is as funny as your tailor.

[3012]
Annotation=Did you think that up all by yourself?

[3013]
Annotation=Ha ha.

[3014]
Annotation=Can we get on with it?

[3015]
Annotation=OK.

[3016]
Annotation=Are you sure you can swim?

[3017]
Annotation=Yup.  The same heroic Elaine Marley who killed the Ghost Pirate LeChuck.

[3018]
Annotation=Why would Governor Marley lie?

[3019]
Annotation=In your dreams.

[3020]
Annotation="Elaine Marley, of course."

[3021]
Annotation=Did you bring a costume and invitation?

[3022]
Annotation=Did you bring a costume?

[3023]
Annotation=Suit yourself.

[3024]
Annotation=Did you bring an invitation?

[3025]
Annotation="Well, what do you know?"

[3026]
Annotation=You do have an invitation.

[3027]
Annotation=Do you have a costume?

[3028]
Annotation=Then you can't go past me.

[3029]
Annotation=Nobody would willingly wear such a dopey costume.

[3030]
Annotation=Do you have an invitation?

[3031]
Annotation="OK, I guess you can go through."

[3032]
Annotation=Have fun.

[3033]
Annotation=Better put it on.

[3034]
Annotation="No, no!  Not here!"

[3035]
Annotation=Go in the bushes or something.

[3036]
Annotation=Geeze...

[3037]
Annotation="Oh, that is nice."

[3038]
Annotation=And the boots are a nice touch.

[3039]
Annotation=Get a grip.

[3040]
Annotation=Don't you know a Mardi Gras costume when you see one?

[3041]
Annotation=Is there something I can help you with?

[3042]
Annotation=Where's your costume for the Governor's party?

[3043]
Annotation=Governor Marley is having a huge Mardi Gras party.

[3044]
Annotation=Invitation only... costumes required... that sort of thing.

[3045]
Annotation=Thanks.

[3046]
Annotation=I'm guarding Governor Marley's mansion.

[3047]
Annotation=You mean Governor Marley's Mardi Gras fish fry?

[3048]
Annotation=It's invitation only and costumes are required.

Annotation=Is that...

[3098]
Annotation=

[3099]
Annotation=What?!?

[3100]
Annotation=Let me see that...

[3101]
Annotation="Boy, it IS alive!"

[3102]
Annotation=We've been looking for a living piece of LeChuck for years!

[3103]
Annotation=Now we can bring him back to life!

[3104]
Annotation=Look out world!

Annotation=Stop bothering me!

[3120]
Annotation=You're a pain!

[3121]
Annotation=Why are you following me around?

[3122]
Annotation=Every time I turn around you're there.

[3123]
Annotation=I can't believe you're in here again.

[3124]
Annotation=Didn't I kick you out of here before?!

[3125]
Annotation=It's people like you who make people like me who we are.

[3126]
Annotation=You're invading my privacy.

[3127]
Annotation=A man's room is his castle.

[3128]
Annotation=Why can't you leave me alone?!?

[3129]
Annotation=I oughta beat you up for coming in here.

[3130]
Annotation="You have some nerve, barging in here."

[3131]
Annotation=How dare you come in here again.

[3132]
Annotation=Get out of my face!

[3133]
Annotation=Get out of here!

[3134]
Annotation=Get away from me!

[3135]
Annotation=Hey!  What the HELL?

[3136]
Annotation=

[3137]
Annotation=What's going on?

[3138]
Annotation=Whoever did this is gonna pay!

[3139]
Annotation=I can't get this thing off my head.

[3140]
Annotation=When I get this thing off my head somebody's gonna be real sorry.

[3141]
Annotation=Who let you into my room?!!

[3142]
Annotation="Well, it ain't."

Annotation=Get out of my room!!

[3151]
Annotation="Scram, kid!"

[3152]
Annotation=Leave me alone!

[3153]
Annotation=I thought I told you to get out!

[3154]
Annotation="You're making me mad, Marty."

[3155]
Annotation=You tell him I'll be back to pick it up... or else.

[3156]
Annotation=Look.  I want it free...and I want it tonight.

[3157]
Annotation=I'm talking about getting my laundry.

[3158]
Annotation="I said, `I need it back tonight.`"

[3159]
Annotation=This is useless.

[3160]
Annotation="I'd swear on my grandfather's grave, something weird is going on."

[3161]
Annotation=Ah...

[3162]
Annotation=LeChuck's crate of voodoo supplies.

[3163]
Annotation=You guys bucking for a tip?

[3164]
Annotation=Well you figured wrong.

[3165]
Annotation=LeChuck don't tip nobody!

[3166]
Annotation="Never, your voodoo lordship."

[3167]
Annotation=So...

[3168]
Annotation=...when are we going to resurrect the old bloated fool?

[3169]
Annotation=Oops...

[3170]
Annotation=It's 'Threepwood'...and I've found him on Scabb Island.

[3171]
Annotation=Yes sir.

[3172]
Annotation="Well... yes sir, but..."

[3173]
Annotation=What good can a chest full of money do him?

[3174]
Annotation=Creep.

[3175]
Annotation=Ah...

[3176]
Annotation=LeChuck sir...

[3177]
Annotation=I regret to report that Guybrush has found one of the map pieces to Big Whoop.

[3178]
Annotation=Yes sir.

[3179]
Annotation=There is one other small little thing.

[3180]
Annotation=Well...

[3181]
Annotation=Sort of...

[3182]
Annotation=Ah...

[3183]
Annotation=LeChuck sir...

[3184]
Annotation=I just wanted to report that we have finished building the new torture chamber you requested.

[3185]
Annotation=Ah...

[3186]
Annotation=No...

[3187]
Annotation=Well...

[3188]
Annotation=Well...

[3189]
Annotation=I was trying to confirm that he really...

[3190]
Annotation=Er...

[3191]
Annotation=You called for me?

[3192]
Annotation=Ah...

[3193]
Annotation=Yes sir...

[3194]
Annotation=I was about...

[3195]
Annotation=I'll head him off before he gets there.

[3196]
Annotation="It will not, your voodoo lordship."

[3197]
Annotation="LeChuck, sir..."

[3198]
Annotation=...I've got good news and I've got bad news.

[3199]
Annotation=The bad news is that Guybrush has found the last piece of the map.

[3200]
Annotation=Ah...

[3201]
Annotation=The good news is that I've got a plan that can't fail.

[3202]
Annotation=Ah...

[3203]
Annotation=You see...

[3204]
Annotation=He must take the map to a cartographer to have it deciphered.

[3205]
Annotation="Yes sir, LeChuck, sir?"

[3206]
Annotation=Yes sir.

[3207]
Annotation="Where do you think YOU'RE going, fancy-pants?"

[3208]
Annotation="Outta my way, fancy-pants!"

[3209]
Annotation="No, more like extortion."

[3210]
Annotation=Here--allow me to demonstrate.

[3211]
Annotation="Aw, there goes all my fun."

[3212]
Annotation=Now I don't get to do this.

[3213]
Annotation=

[3214]
Annotation="Tough guy, huh?"

[3215]
Annotation=Ha ha ha!

[3216]
Annotation=Scream as loud as you want!

[3217]
Annotation=There's no police on Scabb Island!

[3218]
Annotation=I'm the only law on this island!

[3219]
Annotation=I roughs-up what needs roughing-up on this island!

[3220]
Annotation=Maybe?I?should?cut?you?one?out?of?cement!

[3221]
Annotation=Ha ha ha!

[3222]
Annotation=That's a good one. Maybe I won't kill you right now.

[3223]
Annotation=Hey! Yer loaded!

[3224]
Annotation=This is my lucky night!

[3225]
Annotation=Remember...

[3226]
Annotation=Wherever you go...

[3227]
Annotation="On sea or on land,"

[3228]
Annotation=You can't ever hide

[3229]
Annotation=From Largo LaGrande!

[3230]
Annotation="On second thought, stop right there!"

[3231]
Annotation="You ain't from these parts, are ya?"

[3232]
Annotation=This?is?a?toll?bridge.?You?gotta?pay.

[3233]
Annotation="Fork over the dough, or you'll be serving Bloody Marys for a week."

[3234]
Annotation=From your nose.

[3235]
Annotation="Well, you'd better have more tomorrow..."

[3236]
Annotation=...or we might have to move this dump to a new location.

[3237]
Annotation="Like, say, the bottom of the ocean?"

[3238]
Annotation=Ha ha ha.

[3239]
Annotation=

[3240]
Annotation=

[3241]
Annotation=You there!

[3242]
Annotation=Give me my usual.

[3243]
Annotation=And put it in a real glass!

[3244]
Annotation=Let's go!

[3245]
Annotation=What are you waiting for?

[3246]
Annotation=I don't think he's got the lips for it.

[3247]
Annotation=C'mon!  What are you?  Afraid?

[3248]
Annotation=Shouldn't he be disqualified by now?

[3249]
Annotation=Let 'er rip!

[3250]
Annotation="We're with ya, Juicious!"

[3251]
Annotation="Alright, Phlegm-master!"

[3252]
Annotation="C'mon, Captain Loogie!"

[3253]
Annotation="You show 'em, Dribble Boy!"

[3254]
Annotation=Spit!

[3255]
Annotation=Come on!

[3256]
Annotation=You can do it!

[3257]
Annotation="Better not blow it, man."

[3258]
Annotation=Hey spitter hey spitter hey spitter...

[3259]
Annotation=You stink!

[3260]
Annotation="Hummm, baby!"

[3261]
Annotation=Right on!

[3262]
Annotation="No ticket, no laundry."

[3263]
Annotation=I've already cleaned that shirt.

[3264]
Annotation=It's not my size.

[3265]
Annotation="Young man, you should put that back where you dug it up."

[3266]
Annotation=Hey!  I don't launder money here!

[3267]
Annotation=Try investing in a casino.

[3268]
Annotation=What would I do with that?

[3269]
Annotation=I'll see what we have ready for Mr. LaGrande.

[3270]
Annotation=Ah...here it comes.

[3271]
Annotation=I don't know anything about cargo or contraband!

[3272]
Annotation="I'm clean, clean, clean!"

[3273]
Annotation="Sure, sonny, I can get out stew."

[3274]
Annotation=That's easy.

[3275]
Annotation="I can also extract grog, spit, and swamp-mud."

[3276]
Annotation=That's because I'm Maaaad Marty.

[3277]
Annotation=I'm mad about getting your clothes the cleanest they can be.

[3278]
Annotation=Shoot.

[3279]
Annotation="Do you have your claim ticket, sonny?"

[3280]
Annotation=Great.

[3281]
Annotation=Alter rations?

[3282]
Annotation="You mean, change the numbers on your food stamps?"

[3283]
Annotation=You've got some nerve!

[3284]
Annotation=What?  Your wife has fake lashes?

[3285]
Annotation="She got your claim ticket, or something?"

[3286]
Annotation=That's my name--don't wear it out.

[3287]
Annotation=Do I care?

[3288]
Annotation="Party tonight?  Sure, I'll come."

[3289]
Annotation=Don't worry about me.  I've been dry for three years.

[3290]
Annotation="What?  Yeah, we'll stay out all night."

[3291]
Annotation=I know it's here somewhere.

[3292]
Annotation=I saw it a while ago.

[3293]
Annotation=Now where was it?

[3294]
Annotation=The log welted it?

[3295]
Annotation="Well, now that is a good excuse."

[3296]
Annotation=But I can't give you your clothes without a claim ticket.

[3297]
Annotation=What?? You beaned your mom with a broom?

[3298]
Annotation=You should treat her better than that.

[3299]
Annotation=You don't have to shout at me.

[3300]
Annotation=I can hear you.

[3301]
Annotation="But, I can't give you your clothes without a claim ticket."

[3302]
Annotation=Get out? Catch up?

[3303]
Annotation=What do you want me to do?

[3304]
Annotation="No, I don't have wheat loaves."

[3305]
Annotation=You made cards out of sand?

[3306]
Annotation=Taking it bowlin' was a dumb thing to do.

[3307]
Annotation=Why'd you trade it for chocolate-covered ants?

[3308]
Annotation=Your dog got mauled?

[3309]
Annotation=What does that have to do with a claim ticket?

[3310]
Annotation=BOOO!

[3311]
Annotation=HAR HAR HAR HAR!

[3312]
Annotation="You didn't kill me, you little moron!"

[3313]
Annotation=I was already a ghost when you met me!

[3314]
Annotation=You just destroyed my spiritual essence...

[3315]
Annotation=A favor that I will now return!

[3316]
Annotation="I want Guybrush brought to me, and I want him brought alive."

[3317]
Annotation=I am entrusting this to you.

[3318]
Annotation=Do not fail me.

[3319]
Annotation=Aye...

[3320]
Annotation=...Guybrush Threepwood is finished.

[3321]
Annotation=I need you to start building me a very special doll.

[3322]
Annotation="I'll ignore that comment just this one time, Largo..."

[3323]
Annotation=...only because they tell me you've found Guybrush Threekwood.

[3324]
Annotation=Very good.

[3325]
Annotation=No one gets the upper hand on LeChuck without getting what he deserves.

[3326]
Annotation=He must not find the treasure of Big Whoop.

[3327]
Annotation=See to it.

[3328]
Annotation=Aye...

[3329]
Annotation=Largo...

[3330]
Annotation=I hear that Guybrush is looking for the lost treasure of Big Whoop.

[3331]
Annotation=This be true?

[3332]
Annotation=It is not the treasure that is important.

[3333]
Annotation=It is what is buried beneath the treasure that concerns me.

[3334]
Annotation=You will regret a lot more if he finds another.

[3335]
Annotation=Stop him at any cost...

[3336]
Annotation=But remember...

[3337]
Annotation=I want him alive.

[3338]
Annotation=I assume this has to do with Guybrush's capture?

[3339]
Annotation="You've allowed him to find the second map piece, haven't you!!"

[3340]
Annotation=YOU FOOL!

[3341]
Annotation=You are to ready your ship and sail after him yerself!

[3342]
Annotation=FIND HIM OR DIE!

[3343]
Annotation=Very good.

[3344]
Annotation=Do you have anything else to report?

[3345]
Annotation=Largo...

[3346]
Annotation=You have been my trusted henchman for many years...

[3347]
Annotation=But I won't hesitate to drag your entrails from behind my ship...

[3348]
Annotation=...if you do not bring me Guybrush before he finds that treasure!

[3349]
Annotation=Largo!

[3350]
Annotation=Is it true that Guybrush Threepwood has found the third piece of the map to Big Whoop?

[3351]
Annotation=Why did you not come and tell me yerself?

[3352]
Annotation=If your plan fails...

[3353]
Annotation=Guybrush Threepwood...

[3354]
Annotation=Largo!

[3355]
Annotation=Take Guybrush down to the torture chamber and get the machine set up.

[3356]
Annotation=You have finally been caught.

[3357]
Annotation=I have searched every island...

[3358]
Annotation=Sailed every sea...

[3359]
Annotation=And now you are mine.

[3360]
Annotation=What do you have to say for yourself?

[3361]
Annotation=It will ricochet off a bunch of stuff.

[3362]
Annotation=I am growing tired of your stupid questions.

[3363]
Annotation=Prepare to die.

[3364]
Annotation=Safety is not my concern in this situation.

[3365]
Annotation="Think fast, your time is almost up."

[3366]
Annotation=Chicago.

[3367]
Annotation=No.

[3368]
Annotation="Up the stairs and to the left, but you won't need it in a few minutes."

[3369]
Annotation=5 cords.

[3370]
Annotation=One.

[3371]
Annotation=All will be revealed in a few moments.

[3372]
Annotation=Scanned vga art is very expensive.

[3373]
Annotation=Because we had an extra disk.

[3374]
Annotation="In your case, the orphanage."

[3375]
Annotation=Arggggg!

[3376]
Annotation=What be going on in here?

[3377]
Annotation=LARGO!

[3378]
Annotation=Relight the candle!

[3379]
Annotation=GUYBRUSH HAS ESCAPED!

[3380]
Annotation=Find them!

[3381]
Annotation=Hahahaha...

[3382]
Annotation=Do you know what that is?

[3383]
Annotation=It is what is about to happen to you!

[3384]
Annotation=You see that candle over there?

[3385]
Annotation=When it burns through that rope...

[3386]
Annotation=...the bag will fall on the bellows.

[3387]
Annotation="When it is compressed, it will shoot a single lead bullet..."

[3388]
Annotation=...which will ricochet off that pan...

[3389]
Annotation=...then off the shield behind me...

[3390]
Annotation=You be in a heap of trouble Guybrush Threepwood.

[3391]
Annotation=bounce off that other shield...

[3392]
Annotation=...finally striking the green balloon.

[3393]
Annotation="When it pops, it will cause that lever to fall..."

[3394]
Annotation=...releasing that ratchet on the chain wheel...

[3395]
Annotation=...and sending you down into the pit of acid.

[3396]
Annotation=Do you know what happens next?

[3397]
Annotation=I will take your bones...

[3398]
Annotation=...still alive and in great pain...

[3399]
Annotation="Now that you are mine, you will pay for what you did to me."

[3400]
Annotation=...and make them into a chair.

[3401]
Annotation=I will call it my screaming chair.

[3402]
Annotation=Every morning I will sit in it and listen to you scream.

[3403]
Annotation=Any questions?

[3404]
Annotation=Ha ha ha!

[3405]
Annotation=This will be even more torturous than I had hoped!

[3406]
Annotation=Any other questions?

[3407]
Annotation=Silence!

[3408]
Annotation=There is only one thing more painful...

[3409]
Annotation=...than being resurrected from the dead and...

[3410]
Annotation=...crammed into a rotting body.

[3411]
Annotation="The candle burns the rope, releasing the bag of sand."

[3412]
Annotation=The bellows will shoot a lead bullet into that pan.

[3413]
Annotation=Ouch!

[3414]
Annotation=Hey!

[3415]
Annotation=OW!!

[3416]
Annotation=Ow!

[3417]
Annotation="Wow, a '43 steelie!"

[3418]
Annotation=What a find!

[3419]
Annotation=Yeow!

[3420]
Annotation="Whoa, a wheat-back!"

[3421]
Annotation=It's a buffalo head!

[3422]
Annotation="Alright, a double eagle!"

[3423]
Annotation="Hey, a Susan B. Anthony!"

[3424]
Annotation="Cool, an arcade token!"

[3425]
Annotation="A treat for ME, a surprise for YOU."

[3426]
Annotation="No, but I will."

[3427]
Annotation=No...

[3428]
Annotation=The surprise is a VOODOO dolly...

[3429]
Annotation=It's an accessory for this voodoo doll...

[3430]
Annotation=Something like that.

[3431]
Annotation=This is a voodoo doll...

[3432]
Annotation="Why yes, as a matter of fact it IS a voodoo doll..."

[3433]
Annotation=...which I'll be using to torture you...

[3434]
Annotation="...and then send you screaming to another dimension, one of infinite pain!"

[3435]
Annotation=Observe...

[3436]
Annotation="OK, how about this:"

[3437]
Annotation="At last, I'm rid of that pesky little wimp Guybrush!"

[3438]
Annotation=Eh?

[3439]
Annotation=Strange...

[3440]
Annotation=There must be something wrong with my voodoo doll.

[3441]
Annotation="It was supposed to send you to another dimension, not the next room."

[3442]
Annotation="Shoddy materials, I'll bet."

[3443]
Annotation="Well, I guess I'll just try it again."

[3444]
Annotation="No, I want to do this:"

[3445]
Annotation=Heh heh heh.

[3446]
Annotation=That was exhilarating!

[3447]
Annotation="Let's have some more fun, shall we?"

[3448]
Annotation="OK, time to send you screaming to a dimension of infinite pain!"

[3449]
Annotation=Boo!

[3450]
Annotation="Hello, Guybrush."

[3451]
Annotation="That's pretty good, Guybrush..."

[3452]
Annotation=...but not good enough to stop ME!

[3453]
Annotation=You won't escape me this time!

[3454]
Annotation=Not so fast!

[3455]
Annotation=Eh?

[3456]
Annotation="Oh, it's you."

[3457]
Annotation="What, THAT again?"

[3458]
Annotation="Ooh, look at me quakin' in me booties."

[3459]
Annotation=I laugh at you and your puny voodoo tinkerings.

[3460]
Annotation=Hah!

[3461]
Annotation="I'm gonna kick your butt, what do you think about that?"

[3462]
Annotation=Come on!

[3463]
Annotation=You don't scare me!

[3464]
Annotation=You think you're so big?

[3465]
Annotation=Stab the doll again!

[3466]
Annotation=It doesn't hurt!

[3467]
Annotation=I can take it!

[3468]
Annotation=I'm not afraid of your doll!

[3469]
Annotation=What are you gonna do now?

[3470]
Annotation=Ha!

[3471]
Annotation='--take my mask off...

[3472]
Annotation=...choke...

[3473]

[3478]
Annotation=But I want you to--

[3479]
Annotation='--gag--

[3480]
Annotation=I'm much too powerful for you and your puny doll!

[3481]
Annotation=You'll have to do better than that!

[3482]
Annotation=Is that the best you can do?

[3483]
Annotation=You always were a wimp.

[3484]
Annotation=But you've got to see--

[3485]
Annotation='--hack--

[3486]
Annotation='--my TRUE face!

[3487]
Annotation='--gurgle--

[3488]
Annotation="No, no, I promise!"

[3489]
Annotation="Please, come take off the--"

[3490]
Annotation='--argh--

Annotation='--hack--

[3498]
Annotation='--mask.

[3499]
Annotation="What, did you think I was kidding before?"

[3500]
Annotation=That's just as well.

[3501]
Annotation=Our mother told me to hunt you down.

[3502]
Annotation="Look, Guybrush, could you help me out?"

[3503]
Annotation="Stick the leg back on the doll, OK?"

[3504]
Annotation="Well, you remember the time you broke my Junior Ultra Soldier Commando Assault Vehicle?"

[3505]
Annotation="It wasn't a truck, it was a Junior Ultra Soldier Commando Assault Vehicle."

[3506]
Annotation="No, sir."

[3507]
Annotation="All right, all right, I promise!"

[3508]
Annotation="Anything, just put my leg back on!"

[3509]
Annotation="Even if you were to escape, I would always be able to find you again."

[3510]
Annotation=We are bound to one another.

[3511]
Annotation="Search your feelings, you KNOW it to be true!"

[3512]
Annotation=...and I brought a little surprise for you!

[3513]
Annotation=Not really.

[3514]
Annotation=More like...

[3515]
Annotation=...brothers!

[3516]
Annotation=I--

[3517]
Annotation=--am your brother!

[3518]
Annotation="Root beer only works on ghosts, Guybrush."

[3519]
Annotation="Having been resurrected, I'm not a ghost anymore."

[3520]
Annotation=Allow me to demonstrate.

[3521]
Annotation=Aha!

[3522]
Annotation=Caught you!

[3523]
Annotation=Now you're gonna get it!

[3524]
Annotation="Hey, Guybrush!"

[3525]
Annotation=How appropriate.

[3526]
Annotation=But I meant more like...

[3527]
Annotation=It's voodoo time!

[3528]
Annotation="Yes, rather like that."

[3529]
Annotation=Or like...

[3530]
Annotation="Perhaps, but humor me."

[3531]
Annotation=We're tired of rebuilding the wharf every time a boat goes through it.

[3532]
Annotation=That's why it has to be very bright.

[3533]
Annotation=It will have one of the most powerful magnifying lenses in the Caribbean.

[3534]
Annotation="Well, would you like one?"

[3535]

[3537]
Annotation=I'll need some personal information.

[3538]
Annotation=Vices?

[3539]
Annotation=I see.

[3540]
Annotation="All right, your library card will be mailed to the address you gave me."

[3541]
Annotation="In the meantime, take this temporary card."

[3542]
Annotation="You may check books out of the library, but only four at a time."

[3543]
Annotation=Name?

[3544]
Annotation=Address?

[3545]
Annotation=But you DO have one?

[3546]
Annotation=Then stop wasting my time.

[3547]
Annotation=I'll have to issue you a temporary card.

[3548]
Annotation=I said you could only check out four books at a time.

[3549]
Annotation=You'll have to give some back before you can check out any more.

[3550]
Annotation=What book are you looking for?

[3551]
Annotation=SHHHH!!!!

[3552]
Annotation=This is a library!

[3553]
Annotation=WHISPER!

[3554]
Annotation="Now, what is it?"

[3555]
Annotation=You expect me to name every book in the library?

[3556]
Annotation=Use the card catalog like a normal person.

[3557]
Annotation=You already have four books checked out.

[3558]
Annotation=You'll have to give some back.

[3559]
Annotation="You've already checked that book out, Mr. Threepwood."

[3560]
Annotation="You've already checked that book out, Captain Dread."

[3561]
Annotation="You've already checked that book out, Mr. Toothrot."

[3562]
Annotation=That book has been checked out by Governor Phatt.

[3563]
Annotation="OK, here you go."

[3564]
Annotation=That's your limit.

[3565]
Annotation=You'll have to give some books back before you can check out any more.

[3566]
Annotation=Anything else?

[3567]
Annotation=Don't slam the door on your way out.

[3568]
Annotation="Remember, books are the treasure of the mind."

[3569]
Annotation="Remember, silence is golden."

[3570]
Annotation=Please put the lens back in the lighthouse.

[3571]
Annotation="All right, here's your temporary card."

[3572]
Annotation=Thank you.

[3573]
Annotation=Please put that back where you got it.

[3574]
Annotation=No thank you.

[3575]
Annotation=SHHH!!

[3577]
Annotation="Please, be quiet!!"

[3578]

[3579]
Annotation=Lower your voice!!

[3580]
Annotation=This is not `hog-calling` practice!!

[3581]
Annotation=I won't ask you again!

[3582]
Annotation=What do you want this time?

[3583]
Annotation=Do you have a library card?

[3584]
Annotation=There's a new lighthouse being built in town.

[3585]
Annotation=That is a scale model of what it will look like.

[3586]
Annotation=Then why did you?

[3587]
Annotation="Yes, and it will be very bright, too."

[3588]
Annotation=It will have one of the most powerful magnifying lenses in the Caribbean.

[3589]
Annotation="I'd show you with the model, but unfortunately the bulb has burned out."

[3590]
Annotation="It wouldn't be much of a lighthouse if it didn't, now would it?"

[3591]
Annotation=Oh!

[3592]
Annotation="Yes, normally the model works, too."

[3593]
Annotation="The bulb is burned out right now, but there's a scaled-down lens inside."

[3628]
Annotation="Deep in the Caribbean, hidden by an endless storm, lies LeChuck's fortress..."

[3712]
Annotation="I want my granddaughter to marry a REAL man, a CAPTAIN."

[3713]
Annotation=Not a washout like you.

[3714]
Annotation="OK, let's go over it again so no one forgets where we buried the treasure."

[3715]
Annotation="No, no, no, that's not right."

[3716]
Annotation="Oh, the heck with it."

[3717]
Annotation="Let's make a map, and tear it into four pieces."

Annotation=Head due east from the pond to the dinosaur.

[3719]
Annotation=Head north from the dinosaur to the pile of rocks.

[3720]
Annotation=Head due east from the rocks to the X.

[3721]
Annotation=Hey!

[3722]
Annotation=You guys get out of here!

[3723]
Annotation=It's a cold potato and leek soup.

[3724]
Annotation=Yuck. A rat's been swimming in it.

[3725]
Annotation=Yuck. There's a rat swimming in it.

[3726]
Annotation=It's a cold potato and leek soup.

[3727]
Annotation=I've never been much for rodent seasonings.

[3728]
Annotation=It's too heavy.

[3729]
Annotation=I'm no cook.

[3730]
Annotation=It's already closed.

[3731]
Annotation=I'll bet it weighs half a ton.

[3732]
Annotation=That doesn't seem to work.

[3733]
Annotation=Excuse me.

[3734]
Annotation=I don't want to dull the blade.

[3735]
Annotation=I don't want to gunk up the blade.

[3736]
Annotation=My scoutmaster would kill me if he saw me use a knife like that.

[3737]
Annotation=Sharp.

[3738]
Annotation=That doesn't seem to work.

[3739]
Annotation=The fire's out.

[3740]
Annotation=The barkeep would be mad if I left work early.

[3741]
Annotation=The barkeep might see me.

[3742]
Annotation=There's no glass in the window.

[3743]
Annotation=All I can see is water.

[3744]
Annotation=Yuck. It's all cans of fruit cocktail.

[3745]
Annotation=I hate fruit cocktail.

[3746]
Annotation=He looks really into his cooking.

[3747]
Annotation=Good thing this is a cold soup.

[3748]
Annotation=I don't know how good that would taste.

[3749]
Annotation=You're supposed to leave these things open.

[3750]
Annotation=I'd have to have a room first.

[3751]
Annotation=I could lose a finger doing that!

[3752]
Annotation="Aw, isn't that cute."

[3753]
Annotation=I need that!

[3754]
Annotation=I have better things to do than beat up baby reptiles.

[3755]
Annotation=I think all he wants right now is sleep.

[3756]

[3757]
Annotation=It's tied to the post.

[3758]

[3763]
Annotation=I don't need any more.

[3764]
Annotation=Hmmm... only one guest.

[3765]
Annotation=I don't want to steal his bell.

[3766]
Annotation=I feel bad enough setting his alligator free.

[3767]
Annotation=I don't think I'd get away with that.

[3768]
Annotation=I don't think I'd get away with that.

[3769]
Annotation=Busy guy.

[3770]
Annotation=They look pretty old.

[3771]
Annotation=I'd better not touch them...

[3772]
Annotation=It looks like somebody's trying to grow penicillin.

[3773]
Annotation=It's stuck open.

[3774]
Annotation=It's empty.

[3775]
Annotation=It's already open.

[3776]
Annotation=It's already open.

[3777]
Annotation=I should use the pins the voodoo lady gave me.

[3778]
Annotation=I think Largo's out of voodoo range by now.

[3779]
Annotation="It's little, mean-looking, and ugly."

[3780]
Annotation=Just like Largo.

[3781]
Annotation=I think Largo's out of voodoo range.

[3782]
Annotation=Maybe I'll just use these regulation voodoo pins that came with the doll instead.

[3783]
Annotation="Messy, messy, messy."

[3784]
Annotation=Sharp.

[3785]
Annotation=I don't want to pin him.

[3786]
Annotation=I don't want to disturb them.

[3787]
Annotation=I don't want to pin her.

[3788]
Annotation=I don't think I should pin that.

[3789]
Annotation="He's short, but he's mean."

[3790]
Annotation=It's a bucket full of mud sitting on the door jamb.

[3791]
Annotation=Nice April-fresh scent!

[3792]
Annotation=I don't like to get naked in other men's rooms.

[3793]
Annotation=Nice door.

[3794]
Annotation="I'm not sleepy, and that bed is disgusting."

[3795]
Annotation=It doesn't seem to stay closed.

[3796]
Annotation="Largo LaGrande, you are a no-good, vicious, two-bit thug."

[3797]
Annotation=I command you to give me back my money and leave this island!

[3798]
Annotation=Oh.

[3799]
Annotation="Well, I command you to leave this island!"

[3800]
Annotation="Take that, you stumpy little dim-witted toad!"

[3801]
Annotation=That'll teach you to mess with the slayer of the Ghost Pirate LeChuck!

[3802]
Annotation="As a matter of fact, I did."

[3803]
Annotation="Quite an interesting story, actually..."

[3804]
Annotation="She did, did she?"

[3805]
Annotation=Does SHE have one of THESE?

[3806]
Annotation=Yes.  LeChuck's beard.

[3807]
Annotation=Still alive and wriggling.

[3808]
Annotation=Whoops.

[3809]
Annotation=I'm Guybrush Threepwood.

[3810]
Annotation=People don't always recognize me...

[3811]
Annotation=That's why I carry this.

[3812]
Annotation=I don't have time for that now.

[3813]
Annotation=Oops.

[3814]
Annotation=Largo could be back any minute!

[3815]
Annotation=Yikes.

[3816]
Annotation=Sorry.

[3817]
Annotation=Bye.

[3818]
Annotation=I don't want to be that close to him.

[3819]
Annotation=I think I hear Largo coming.

[3820]
Annotation=Maybe I shouldn't have done that.

[3821]
Annotation=He looked pretty steamed.

[3822]
Annotation=I... uh... thought it was my room?

[3823]
Annotation=It's a bit on the tattered side.

[3824]
Annotation=I was just leaving.

[3825]
Annotation=There's strange little white bugs all over it.

[3826]
Annotation=I don't think I should do that.

[3827]
Annotation=I don't think I should do that.

[3828]
Annotation=I don't like styrofoam.

[3829]
Annotation=It's bad for the environment.

[3830]
Annotation=I don't see anything special about it.

[3831]
Annotation="Then again, I never really have understood art."

[3832]
Annotation=It's sparkly clean.

[3833]
Annotation=That you're a pack of loonies?

[3834]
Annotation=He looks nice enough.

[3835]
Annotation=Not my size.

[3836]
Annotation=It's a bucket full of mud.

[3837]
Annotation=They're sleeping peacefully.

[3838]
Annotation=I think he wanted me to polish it FOR him.

[3839]
Annotation=I think they'd be mad at me for trapping their rat...

[3840]
Annotation="Somehow, I don't feel like they've earned it."

[3841]
Annotation=I doubt they'd be interested.

[3842]
Annotation=I did a pretty good job on it.

[3843]
Annotation=That wouldn't be wise.

[3844]
Annotation=There's not much left to polish.

[3845]
Annotation=That would be redundant.

[3846]
Annotation=It would take forever to hack through it with this knife.

[3847]
Annotation=It's just a bucket.

[3848]
Annotation=No need for that now.

[3849]
Annotation=It's propped up by the twig.

[3850]
Annotation=It's closed.

[3851]
Annotation=It won't fit in my pocket.

[3852]
Annotation=One of my favorites!

[3853]
Annotation=The box is closed.

[3854]
Annotation=That wouldn't taste very good.

[3855]
Annotation=He looks too scared to eat.

[3856]
Annotation=I've played with that enough.

[3857]
Annotation=I think I'm too clumsy to hold the stick and tie a knot at the same time.

[3858]
Annotation=That doesn't seem to work.

[3859]
Annotation=I think it's yo-yo string.

[3860]
Annotation=Cute little fella!

[3861]
Annotation="`No, we don't clean leather.`"

[3862]
Annotation=`Not responsible for lost buttons or hooks.`

[3863]
Annotation=`Not responsible for stains left on clothing.`

[3864]
Annotation=What do you know about Largo LaGrande?

[3865]
Annotation=Who are you?

[3866]
Annotation=I've got a laundry-type question.

[3867]
Annotation=I'd like to pick up some clothes.

[3868]
Annotation=Got it right here.

[3869]
Annotation=I don't like mud in my drinks.

[3870]
Annotation=Do you do alterations here?

[3871]
Annotation=I'm sorry.

[3872]
Annotation=I'd like to keep my claim ticket for taxes.

[3873]
Annotation=I dropped it in my grog and it melted.

[3874]
Annotation=Mom threw it out when she cleaned my room.

[3875]
Annotation=Hey...

[3876]
Annotation=Hi.

[3877]
Annotation=Long time no see.

[3878]
Annotation=Remember me?  I'm Guybrush.

[3879]
Annotation=Did you ever get that circus started?

[3880]
Annotation="Hey, guys..."

[3881]
Annotation=Yo...

[3882]
Annotation=Yoo hoo...

[3883]
Annotation=Ahem.

[3884]
Annotation=Excuse me.

[3885]
Annotation=Yoo hoo.

[3886]
Annotation=WAKE UP!

[3887]
Annotation="I'm Guybrush Threepwood, a mighty pirate."

[3888]
Annotation="I'm Guybrush, the man who rid the world of LeChuck."

[3889]
Annotation="No, really--"

[3890]
Annotation="I'm Guybrush.  You tried to sell me the minutes of a PTA meeting in the last game, claiming it was a map."

[3891]
Annotation=I don't want to drink from a bucket.

[3892]
Annotation="I'm Guybrush, and I was just leaving."

[3893]
Annotation=What are you guys doing up there?

[3894]
Annotation=Why aren't you still doing that?

[3895]
Annotation=Yeah?

[3896]
Annotation=What did you do with the money?

[3897]
Annotation=What does this have to do with `performing?`

[3898]
Annotation=Then what happened?

[3899]
Annotation=But what does this have to do with `performing?`

[3900]
Annotation="Big Whoop?  I'm looking for that, too!"

[3901]
Annotation=What?!  What is it?!  What did he say?!  Tell me already!

[3902]
Annotation=When do we get to the performing part?

[3903]
Annotation="Big Whoop?  Er, did you find anything?"

[3904]
Annotation=I don't see what this has to do with `performing.`

[3905]
Annotation=There isn't enough spit to put in the bucket.

[3906]
Annotation=How much longer is this story?

[3907]
Annotation=I think it's past my bedtime.

[3908]
Annotation=That you should bore passers-by to tears with long stories?

[3909]
Annotation=How come you have to perform on that ledge?

[3910]
Annotation=Give me money for the polish.

[3911]
Annotation="Say, I've got some time to get that polish now."

[3912]
Annotation=Is that your rat?

[3913]
Annotation=See you later.

[3914]
Annotation="Oh, I see."

[3915]
Annotation=I think you're overlooking the potential symbolism to be gained by your closeness to the earth.

[3916]
Annotation=Sounds like a crock of monkey snot to me.

[3917]
Annotation=What?

[3918]
Annotation=I hate vichyssoise.

[3919]
Annotation=Dirtaphobia?

[3920]
Annotation=Groundaphobia?

[3921]
Annotation=Terrafirmaphobia?

[3922]
Annotation=Stupidity?

[3923]
Annotation=Fear of killer whales?

[3924]
Annotation=Fear of strange vegetables?

[3925]
Annotation=Sounds more like `workaphobia` to me.

[3926]
Annotation="Sorry, is this your bucket?"

[3927]
Annotation="So, you won't mind if I take it?"

[3928]
Annotation=Do you think you could let me have this bucket?

[3929]
Annotation=Pretty please with sugar and a cherry?

[3930]
Annotation="Pretty please with sugar, nuts, and a cherry?"

[3931]
Annotation="Pretty please with sugar, nuts, a cherry, and chocolate sprinkles?"

[3932]
Annotation=I really need it.

[3933]
Annotation=I really really need it.

[3934]
Annotation=I really desperately need it.

[3935]
Annotation=It's a matter of life and death.

[3936]
Annotation=If you don't give it to me I'll never speak to you again.

[3937]
Annotation=I'll be your best friend.

[3938]
Annotation=I'll be your best friend forever and ever.

[3939]
Annotation=Please?

[3940]
Annotation="Aw, come on, be a pal."

[3941]
Annotation=I didn't want that old bucket anyway.

[3942]
Annotation=Pretty please?

[3943]
Annotation=Pretty pretty please?

[3944]
Annotation=Pretty please with sugar on top?

[3945]
Annotation=OK.

[3946]
Annotation=OK.

[3947]
Annotation=OK.

[3948]
Annotation=I'd better beat it in case those guys wake up!

[3949]
Annotation=Nice April-fresh scent!

[3950]
Annotation=Would you be able to get out ketchup?

[3951]
Annotation=Uh... nothing.

[3952]
Annotation="Actually, nothing.  I don't care about clean clothes."

[3953]
Annotation=I didn't think you would.

[3954]
Annotation=No.  Forget it.

[3955]
Annotation=That won't do anything.

[3956]
Annotation=I made Largo leave this island.

[3957]
Annotation=It was stolen.

[3958]
Annotation=I must have left it in my other pants.

[3959]
Annotation=I think I'd better make myself scarce instead.

[3960]
Annotation=I lost it while being keelhauled.

[3961]
Annotation="Oh, never mind."

[3962]
Annotation="NO, I DON'T HAVE MY CLAIM TICKET."

[3963]
Annotation="Oops.  I thought I wanted to talk to you, but I don't."

[3964]
Annotation=Sure.

[3965]
Annotation=What happened to your leg?

[3966]
Annotation="Actually, I'm kind of busy right now."

[3967]
Annotation=I guess I'll be going now.

[3968]
Annotation=I don't think that will work.

[3969]
Annotation=He looks buff.

[3970]
Annotation=I don't think he'd like that.

[3971]
Annotation="It says, `Woody.`"

[3972]
Annotation=I don't think he'd like that.

[3973]
Annotation=It says `Out on house call.`

[3974]
Annotation=`Please come again.`

[3975]
Annotation=I don't want it.

[3976]
Annotation=I don't want it.

[3977]
Annotation=I don't feel like it.

[3978]
Annotation=I don't feel like it.

[3979]
Annotation=I can't.  He's lacquered it onto the wall.

[3980]
Annotation=It's too heavy to move.

[3981]
Annotation=I'm not a carpenter.

[3982]
Annotation=No thanks.  I don't touch other people's stools.

[3983]
Annotation=If only I could use this stuff on my lines...

[3984]
Annotation=I don't want to polish that.

[3985]
Annotation="Good practice, but I think I need some wood."

[3986]
Annotation=I can't reach it.

[3987]
Annotation=It's too high.

[3988]
Annotation=Excuse me... could you take a look at this?

[3989]
Annotation=Pounds and pounds of nails.

[3990]
Annotation=Comfortable looking chair.

[3991]
Annotation=Nice catch!

[3992]
Annotation="Oh boy, it's Buzzsaw Girl!"

[3993]
Annotation="Nice, sturdy workbench."

[3994]
Annotation=What a cute little stool.

[3995]
Annotation=That's about the best peg leg I've ever seen.

[3996]
Annotation=Nice peg leg.

[3997]
Annotation=Nice craftsmanship.

[3998]
Annotation=Could I buy some wood polish?

[3999]
Annotation="I'd just like to browse, thanks."

[4000]
Annotation=I'd like to look around a bit.

[4001]
Annotation=I don't think I should hammer that.

[4002]
Annotation=Ahem...

[4003]
Annotation=Oh.

[4004]
Annotation=What's the problem with that Largo guy?

[4005]
Annotation="Like, an all-night tattoo parlor?"

[4006]
Annotation=Nice apron.  Are you some sort of chef?

[4007]
Annotation=How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?

[4008]
Annotation="But if a woodchuck could chuck and would chuck some amount of wood, what amount of wood would a woodchuck chuck?"

[4009]
Annotation="A woodchuck should chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood, as long as a woodchuck would chuck wood."

[4010]
Annotation=Oh.  Shut up.

[4011]
Annotation=Largo LaGrande will never bother you again!

[4012]
Annotation="No, it was me!"

[4013]
Annotation="Ummm, well..."

[4014]
Annotation="Oh, never mind."

[4015]
Annotation=Nothing like a pocket full of nails to keep you on your toes.

[4016]
Annotation=I don't think I should nail that.

[4017]
Annotation="I may be a lazy guy, but carrying around my own place to sit is too much."

[4018]
Annotation=I don't have time to sit.

Annotation="Well, no thanks are necessary."

[4385]
Annotation="You see, I--"

Annotation=Oh.

[4411]
Annotation=He doesn't scare me.  Just tell me where I can find him.

[4412]
Annotation=Could I hide out here for a while?

[4413]
Annotation="Whatever bounty LeChuck's offering, I'll double it."

[5425]
Annotation=It's just an empty mug.

[5426]

[5427]
Annotation=Looks like an awful lot of grog.

[5428]
Annotation="Yuch, mud."

[5429]
Annotation=It's filled with a colored drink.

[5430]
Annotation=I don't like watered-down grog.

[5431]
Annotation=Gross.

[5432]
Annotation=I'm conducting a survey.  May I ask you a few questions?

[5433]
Annotation=There's no need to do that anymore.

[5434]
Annotation=The mug is already empty.

[5435]
Annotation=A brick is a brick is a brick.

[5436]
Annotation=I don't want to carry that around.

[5437]
Annotation=I can't move that.

[5438]
Annotation=I'm not a mason.

[5439]
Annotation=He certainly does like his rum.

[5440]
Annotation=They all say `RUM`.

[5441]
Annotation=I can't hold my alcohol.

[5442]

[5443]
Annotation=Is the lady of the house home?

[5444]
Annotation=They're half empty.

[5445]
Annotation=It's empty.

[5446]
Annotation=It looks just like my mug of grog.

[5447]
Annotation=I think I'll leave it here for Rum Rogers.

[5448]
Annotation=I don't want to sit right now.

[5449]
Annotation=Just like the trap door I had when I was a kid.

[5450]
Annotation=It won't budge.

[5451]
Annotation=I'm looking for a map.

[5452]
Annotation=Oops.  Wrong place.

[5453]
Annotation=I heard about this guy who used to live here...

[5454]
Annotation=I'd like to find out some information from you.

[5455]
Annotation=No house should be without one of these.

[5456]
Annotation=It's a skeleton holding a piece of map.

[5457]
Annotation=It's not mine to use.

[5458]
Annotation=Looks like he died while taking a bath.

[5459]
Annotation=Yuck!  I don't want to touch it.

[5460]
Annotation=Skeletons don't talk.

[5461]
Annotation=I can't reach it.

[5462]
Annotation=I can see inside Rum's house from here.

[5463]
Annotation=It says `Trespassers not delivering foodstuffs will be persecuted.`

[5464]
Annotation=The gate is closed.

[5465]
Annotation=I'd love to stay and chat but I'm due at the manicurist's.

[5466]
Annotation=I got time off for good behavior.

[5467]
Annotation=You must be confusing me with my cousin Guybrush.

[5468]
Annotation=Governor Phatt had me set free.

[5469]
Annotation="Yes, but I broke out."

[5470]
Annotation=Can I go upstairs?

[5471]
Annotation=When will the Governor be finished eating?

[5472]
Annotation=I think there's a fire in the kitchen.

[5473]
Annotation="Look behind you, a three-headed monkey!"

[5474]
Annotation=There are crumbs and condiments all over it.

[5475]
Annotation=Ick.

[5476]
Annotation=I think I almost woke him up!

[5477]

Annotation=The cover says

[5480]
Annotation=The cover says

[5481]
Annotation=The cover says

Annotation=There's food or something stuck in the drain.

[5483]
Annotation=It seems to go off before stuff comes out of the tube.

[5484]
Annotation=I don't think this has been washed in about ten years.

[5485]
Annotation=I don't think I'd better wake him up.

[5486]
Annotation=Sleeping like a baby.

[5487]
Annotation=...a baby elephant.

[5488]
Annotation=I don't think I could move him.

[5489]
Annotation=I don't think I'd better wake him up.

[5490]
Annotation="Yeah, let's blow this popsicle stand."

[5491]
Annotation="No, I need to take care of a few things first."

[5492]
Annotation=I'm not sure where I want to go.

[5493]
Annotation=I think I should save my breath.

[5494]
Annotation=Who knows what enormous deadly cave creature I'd wake up?

[5495]
Annotation=No thanks.

[5496]
Annotation=Just to let LeChuck know where I am?

[5497]
Annotation=No thanks.

[5498]
Annotation=I don't think this is a good spot.

[5499]
Annotation=Bad acoustics.

[5501]
Annotation=Come here often?

[5502]
Annotation=I can hold my breath for ten minutes!

[5510]
Annotation=Wanna see my scar?

[5511]
Annotation=Let's get out of here and go someplace where we can talk.

Annotation=If I said you had a beautiful body would you hold it against me?

[5513]
Annotation=Aren't you a famous model?

[5514]
Annotation=Wanna help me search for buried treasure?

[5515]
Annotation=You look like a pretty classy babe.

[5516]
Annotation=You must be a stewardess.

[5550]
Annotation=Dang!  There goes all my fun.

[5551]

[5552]
Annotation=The echo might kill me.

[5553]
Annotation=I meant a REAL treasure hunt.  You know.  For money.

[5554]
Annotation=What kind of mishaps?

[5555]
Annotation="Well, I'd better let you get back to work..."

[5556]
Annotation=Marley?  That's funny.  I used to date a Governor Marley.

[5557]
Annotation=How do you know so much about parties?

[5558]
Annotation=Maybe I'll just go up there now.  Bye.

[5559]

[5699]
Annotation="It's made out of rare, ecologically safe materials."

[5700]
Annotation="Actually, it's so valuable, I'd better keep it."

[5701]
Annotation=It's a deal.

[5702]
Annotation=What do you mean?  It's worth a mint!

[5703]
Annotation=You'd be interested if you knew how valuable it was.

[5704]
Annotation="OK, but you're missing a great deal here."

[5705]
Annotation=That's not just any lump of pus.

[5706]
Annotation=It's better than most of the junk in here.

[5707]
Annotation="Fine.  Your loss, buddy."

[5708]
Annotation=Thanks.

[5709]
Annotation=What would you trade for the map piece?

[5710]
Annotation=Sure.  I'll take the map piece.

[5711]
Annotation=The bag is empty.

[5712]
Annotation=The bag is empty.

[5713]
Annotation=

[5714]
Annotation=`Beware of Parrot`

[5715]
Annotation=Better not.  That parrot looks mean.

[5716]
Annotation=I paid for it.

[5717]
Annotation=I don't have to put it back.

[5718]
Annotation=I don't want to hang that there.

[5719]
Annotation=It has a picture of a parrot on the front.

[5720]
Annotation=Can you tell me about the ship with the figurehead?

[5721]
Annotation=Can I get the map piece now?

[5722]
Annotation=I think he likes it where it is.

[5723]
Annotation=I don't want to make that parrot mad.

[5724]
Annotation=It's not mine to use.

[5725]
Annotation="It may be old, but it's still shiny and sharp."

[5726]
Annotation=I don't think I should cut that.

[5727]
Annotation=I don't think he'd like that.

[5728]
Annotation=He looks like he's really into this stuff.

[5729]
Annotation="Call me Stingy,"

[5730]
Annotation=but I'm not giving away my money.

[5731]
Annotation=That's worth way too much to give back.

[5732]
Annotation=That's not mine to give away.

[5733]
Annotation=What?!!

[5734]
Annotation=Am I nuts?

[5735]
Annotation=Please tell me about the ship with the figurehead again.

[5736]
Annotation=He's preoccupied with his reflection.

[5737]
Annotation=I think he's in love.

[5738]
Annotation=I'm not that stupid.

[5739]
Annotation=I'm not giving that away.

[5740]
Annotation="Actually, this might come in handy later."

[5741]
Annotation=I'd like to keep this so I can look at myself.

[5742]
Annotation="Yeah, he seems to be in love with his reflection."

[5743]
Annotation=I don't want to pin him.

[5744]
Annotation=Excuse me...

[5745]
Annotation=I'd like to rent a costume.

[5746]
Annotation=I'd really like to rent a costume.

[5747]
Annotation=I'd really REALLY like to rent a costume.

[5748]
Annotation=I NEED to rent a costume.

[5749]
Annotation=What a beautiful dress!

[5750]
Annotation=I HAVE TO rent a costume.

[5751]
Annotation=My life depends on renting a costume.

[5752]
Annotation=Did I ask you about renting a costume yet?

[5753]
Annotation="Um, I'm looking for a costume."

[5754]
Annotation=PLEASE rent me a costume.

[5755]
Annotation=But you have tons of costumes.

[5756]
Annotation=Why are your costumes so popular?

[5757]
Annotation=You look busy.  I'll come back later.

[5758]
Annotation=This is really nice.

[5759]
Annotation=I don't want to wear this right now.

[5760]
Annotation=Neat.

[5761]
Annotation=I like this one.

[5762]
Annotation=Great costume.

[5763]
Annotation=I had one like that when I was a kid.

[5764]
Annotation=I think this one's my favorite.

[5765]
Annotation=I wonder if I can rent this one.

[5766]
Annotation=That reminds me:

[5767]
Annotation=I want to buy the latest comic book by Steve Purcell.

[5768]
Annotation=I should check with the shopkeeper first.

[5769]
Annotation=That doesn't look like any cannibal I've ever seen.

[5770]
Annotation="I don't know what it is, but it sure is ugly."

[5771]
Annotation=He looks really busy.

[5772]
Annotation=I can't reach it.

[5773]
Annotation=I can't reach it.

[5774]
Annotation=I can't reach it.

[5775]
Annotation=It doesn't seem to open.

[5776]
Annotation=It doesn't seem to open.

[5777]
Annotation=It doesn't seem to open.

[5778]
Annotation=I can't move it.

[5779]
Annotation=I can't move it.

[5780]
Annotation=I can't move it.

[5781]
Annotation=I don't see anything special about it.

[5782]
Annotation=I don't see anything special about it.

[5783]
Annotation=I don't see anything special about it.

[5784]
Annotation=I can't pick that up.

[5785]
Annotation=I can't pick that up.

[5786]
Annotation=I can't pick that up.

[5787]
Annotation=I can't reach that from here.

[5788]
Annotation=I can't reach that from here.

[5789]
Annotation=I can't reach that from here.

[5790]
Annotation=That doesn't seem to work.

[5791]
Annotation=That doesn't seem to work.

[5792]
Annotation=That doesn't seem to work.

[5793]
Annotation=Hmm. This door appears to be locked.

[5794]
Annotation=I'm not holding it.

[5795]
Annotation=Ha!

[5796]
Annotation=Those guys wouldn't know a good story even if they paid fifty bucks for it.

[5797]
Annotation=When I find Big Whoop I'll become a legend among pirates for generations to come.

[5798]
Annotation=If I could only charter a ship and get off this stinking island...

[5799]
Annotation=`Steamin' Weenies!-- 20 ft.`

[5800]
Annotation=Too heavy.

[5801]
Annotation=Nice stick.

[5802]
Annotation=`Rapp Scallion's Steamin' Weenie Hut...

[5803]
Annotation=...place order here.`

[5804]
Annotation=For what? It's closed down.

[5805]
Annotation=Looks closed.

[5806]
Annotation=Looks closed.

[5807]
Annotation="Actually, I'd just like to browse."

[5808]
Annotation="Aw, shucks."

[5809]
Annotation=Didn't you used to be a used-ship salesman?

[5810]
Annotation=Do you do funerals?

[5811]
Annotation=I'm not actually in the market for a coffin yet.

[5812]
Annotation=Rentals?

[5813]
Annotation=I need to get something embalmed.

[5814]
Annotation=I never knew morticians were so clever.

[5815]
Annotation=I gotta go.  See you later.

[5816]
Annotation=Could you get in and show me how big it is again?

[5817]
Annotation="Actually, I'm one of those poor customers you were talking about."

[5818]
Annotation=It's already nailed shut.

[5819]
Annotation=But I don't have a hammer.

[5820]
Annotation=But I don't have any nails.

[5821]
Annotation=But it's open.

[5822]
Annotation=Dang.  Looks like it's empty.

[5823]
Annotation=Spacious.

[5824]
Annotation=I'm no magician.

[5825]
Annotation=I'm not ready for that yet.

[5826]
Annotation=Could you show me that coffin again?

[5827]
Annotation=Nice finish.

[5828]
Annotation=I don't want to get in trouble.

[5829]
Annotation=It's open and empty.

[5830]
Annotation=It's locked.

[5831]
Annotation=It's locked.

[5832]
Annotation=I nailed them in there pretty good.

[5833]
Annotation=Don't think I can get them out.

[5834]
Annotation=That's disgusting!

[5835]
Annotation="`When the tears come, shouldn't you be prepared?"

[5836]
Annotation='-Stans Previously-Owned Coffins.`

[5837]
Annotation=How much is that coffin?

[5838]
Annotation=I don't have much.

[5839]
Annotation=That's very considerate of you.

[5840]
Annotation="`Stan's Kozy Krypts-- A Place to Spend Eternity, Not a Fortune.`"

[5841]
Annotation=It's nailed shut!

[5842]
Annotation=It's empty.

[5843]
Annotation=I'm looking for a good used coffin.

[5844]
Annotation=Elaine Marley?  From M?l?e Island?

[5845]
Annotation="But, I killed LeChuck!"

[5846]
Annotation=Jealousy?

[5847]
Annotation=Revenge?

[5848]
Annotation=Fame and fortune?

[5849]
Annotation=For attention?

[5850]
Annotation=Gotta go.  Keep up the good work.

[5851]
Annotation=I have my costume right here.

[5852]
Annotation=This is my costume.

[5853]
Annotation="Uh, I didn't want to go anyway."

[5854]
Annotation=I've got my invitation right here.

[5855]
Annotation=I don't have an invitation.

[5856]
Annotation="Well, if you insist."

[5857]
Annotation=But you'll have to try to restrain yourself.

[5858]
Annotation=I'd rather not wear this costume in public.

[5859]
Annotation=THE GHOST PIRATE LECHUCK!!!!

[5860]
Annotation=Nothing inside.

[5861]
Annotation=I'm here for the Governor's party.

[5862]
Annotation=You mentioned a party before...

[5863]
Annotation=Nice costume.  Almost scared me to death.

[5864]
Annotation=What are you guarding here?

[5865]
Annotation=Elaine Marley?  From M?l?e Island?

[5866]
Annotation=Party?  What party?

[5867]
Annotation="Well, shoot."

[5868]
Annotation=Maybe while I'm in the woods I'll ditch this stupid costume.

[5869]
Annotation="I should probably stay in costume, for now."

[5870]
Annotation=I'm here for the party.  Want to see my invitation?

[5871]
Annotation="Try and catch me, old man!"

[5872]
Annotation="Aw, what a cute little thing."

[5873]
Annotation=Now why would I want to pick on such a cute little puppy?

[5874]
Annotation=I'm fetching enough already in this dress.

[5875]
Annotation=That doesn't seem to smell interesting to him.

[5876]
Annotation=I'd better not.

[5877]
Annotation=He's got a rake.

[5878]
Annotation=Hey!

[5879]
Annotation=It looks like it's about to blow away.

[5880]
Annotation="What's the matter, boy?"

[5881]
Annotation=Smell something?

[5882]
Annotation=Uh... nice doggie...

[5883]
Annotation="Hey, that's a good idea."

[5884]
Annotation=Whoops.  Too late.

[5885]
Annotation=What the...

[5886]
Annotation=Hey...

[5887]
Annotation=Dang wind.

[5888]
Annotation=Come back here!

[5889]
Annotation=Slippery little devil...

[5890]
Annotation=Hold still.

[5891]
Annotation="OK, that does it."

[5892]
Annotation=I think I've had enough fun with this poor little dog already.

[5893]
Annotation=Nothing a big hug wouldn't cure.

[5894]
Annotation="I'd like to, but this dress just doesn't have the pockets for it."

[5895]
Annotation="I'd like to, but this dress just doesn't have the pockets for it."

[5896]
Annotation=I'm going to ditch this thing once and for all.

[5897]
Annotation="OK, dog."

[5898]
Annotation=You're coming with me.

[5899]
Annotation=I don't think he's interested.

[5900]
Annotation=Ha!

[5901]
Annotation=Bark as loud as you want!

[5902]
Annotation=Filbert's out raking the back forty.

[5903]
Annotation=LeChuck's alive and I'm on the lam!

[5904]
Annotation=This crazy mutt is trying to kill me!

[5905]
Annotation=How did you know my name?

[5906]
Annotation=She named her DOG Guybrush?

[5907]
Annotation=Mr. Threepwood.  Take me to the Governor right away.

[5908]
Annotation=I'm Governor Marley's ex-boyfriend.  She's expecting me.

[5909]
Annotation=I'm selling these fine pink dresses.

[5910]
Annotation=I think I've been enough of a pest.

[5911]
Annotation=It IS closed.

[5912]
Annotation=It's a beat-up metal trash can.

[5913]
Annotation=No way.

[5914]
Annotation=It probably smells.

[5915]
Annotation="It says, `Dear Booty Island Waste Disposal Service:"

[5916]
Annotation=Shhhh!

[5917]
Annotation=Please don't bang garbage cans.

[5918]
Annotation=Governor sleeping upstairs.`

[5919]
Annotation=They're empty.

[5920]
Annotation=No thanks.  They reek of fish.

[5921]
Annotation=It's empty.

[5922]
Annotation=No thanks.  It reeks of fish.

[5923]
Annotation="Can I see both of your ID's, please?"

[5924]
Annotation=Nice costume.

[5925]
Annotation="Some party, eh?"

[5926]
Annotation=Hi.  My name's Guybrush.

[5927]
Annotation=Don't I know you from somewhere?

[5928]
Annotation=Where'd you get that drink?

[5929]
Annotation=So how do you know Elaine?

[5930]
Annotation=Haven't you ever heard of mono?

[5931]
Annotation=Anyone seen the Governor?

[5932]
Annotation=Tried the fish?

[5933]
Annotation="This is some house, wouldn't you say?"

[5934]
Annotation="So, when do we bob for apples?"

[5935]
Annotation="Say, did you make that costume yourself?"

[5936]
Annotation=Hey!  Let's form a bunny hop line!

[5937]
Annotation="Well, it's been nice talking to you."

[5938]
Annotation=Gotta go now.

[5939]
Annotation=Is there a bathroom in here?

[5940]
Annotation=What did you say your name was?

[5941]
Annotation=I just heard the funniest story...

[5942]
Annotation="Step aside, please."

[5943]
Annotation=This is fun.

[5944]
Annotation="We should all do this more often, don't you think?"

[5945]
Annotation=So are you wearing anything under there?

[5946]
Annotation="OK, party's over.  Time to go home."

[5947]
Annotation=Nice costume.

[5948]
Annotation=I can't get by these people on the stairs.

[5949]
Annotation=It looks like part of the map to Big Whoop!

[5950]
Annotation=It's not mine to use.

[5951]
Annotation=Looks like I'm too late for the hors d'oeuvres.

[5952]
Annotation=Too late--they're already picked clean.

[5953]
Annotation=They seem to be enjoying the party.

[5954]
Annotation=I'm not dressed for wrestling.

[5955]
Annotation=Can I just squeeze by?

[5956]
Annotation=Get a room.

[5957]
Annotation=She's gone.

[5958]
Annotation=I guess I really made her mad this time.

[5959]
Annotation=I've decided to let you come back to me.

[5960]
Annotation=I'm waiting for your apology.

[5961]
Annotation="Is it my imagination, or have you gained weight?"

[5962]
Annotation=The last time I stole something from Governor Marley I almost ended up as fish food.

[5963]
Annotation=I came all this way to see you--at least get me a beer.

[5964]
Annotation=Great to see you again.  Is there any food in this dump?

[5965]
Annotation=Gosh you're cute when you're pretending to be mad.

[5966]
Annotation="Your lonely nights are over, baby.  I have returned."

[5967]
Annotation=How's your sister?  The REALLY good-looking one?

[5968]
Annotation="You know, I kinda liked your old house better."

[5969]
Annotation=So tell me... You and the gardener?  Eh?

[5970]
Annotation="Still not afraid to use a lot of perfume, I see."

[5971]
Annotation=What I really could use now is a grade-A footrub.

[5972]
Annotation=Why don't you slip into something more comfortable?

[5973]
Annotation="Man, she has shoulder pads in everything."

[5974]
Annotation="Still ignoring fashion, eh?  Good for you."

[5975]
Annotation="I got a feeling someone needs a big, sloppy kiss."

[5976]
Annotation="So, who's the father?"

[5977]
Annotation=Why don't you just give me that map like a good girl?

[5978]
Annotation=Better give me that map.  Treasure huntin's men's work.

[5979]
Annotation="Elaine, take me back.  I can't live without you."

[5980]
Annotation=Won't you at least give me a second chance?

[5981]
Annotation=I realize now what a fool I've been.

[5982]
Annotation=My life's been meaningless without you.

[5983]
Annotation="If I can't be with you, I don't want to live."

[5984]
Annotation=I think I'm wearing enough women's clothes right now.

[5985]
Annotation=Life without you is an endless nightmare.

[5986]
Annotation=You were right.  I was a buffoon.  And a weenie.

[5987]
Annotation="Have pity on my poor, broken soul."

[5988]
Annotation=Can't you see how my heart has suffered?

[5989]
Annotation="Elaine, save me from this whirlpool of misery."

[5990]
Annotation=I'd jump out that window to prove my love.

[5991]
Annotation=May lightning strike me if I bear false intentions!

[5992]
Annotation="I'll win you back, if it's the last thing I do!"

[5993]
Annotation="My soul is sick, Elaine, and love is the only cure."

[5994]
Annotation="If you won't take me back, just kill me now."

[5995]
Annotation=I'm warm enough in the one I have on.

[5996]
Annotation=Please baby please baby please baby please baby please.

[5997]
Annotation=Maybe we should talk about this.

[5998]
Annotation=Don't you like my new beard?

[5999]
Annotation=Those other women meant nothing to me.

[6000]
Annotation="LeChuck's alive, and I need your help to fight him."

[6001]
Annotation="I'm not sure, but don't you owe me some money?"

[6002]
Annotation=Come on.  Let me buy you a grog.

[6003]
Annotation=I stopped doing that knuckle-cracking thing.

[6004]
Annotation=I should warn you--I cancelled the boat insurance.

[6005]
Annotation=Do you have my red sweater?  I can't find it anywhere.

[6006]
Annotation=I like what you've done with your hair.

[6007]
Annotation=Is that a new blouse?

[6008]
Annotation="Real scorcher outside, eh?"

[6009]
Annotation=Have you been forwarding all my mail?

[6010]
Annotation=That's some party downstairs...

[6011]
Annotation="You're the Governor of my heart, baby."

[6012]
Annotation=Nothing back here.

[6013]
Annotation="I'd like to, but I'd better stay in costume."

[6014]
Annotation=I'm pretty comfortable in what I have on.

[6015]
Annotation="Hey, it's Kyle Katarn in a dress!"

[6016]
Annotation=I can see the map fluttering around in the front yard.

[6017]
Annotation="Hey, it's Kyle Katarn!"

[6018]
Annotation=`Central Caribbean School for Governors...

[6019]
Annotation=...Crew '67`

[6020]
Annotation="Well, maybe she won't miss this old thing."

[6021]
Annotation="It's destiny, honeycakes!"

[6022]
Annotation=Snugglepuss!

[6023]
Annotation=Punkydoodle!

[6024]
Annotation=Pooper-dooper!

[6025]
Annotation="Look at us, together again."

[6026]
Annotation=Boy.  We haven't been like this since...

[6027]
Annotation=...well...

[6028]
Annotation="Was that what happened?  Gee, I thought..."

[6029]
Annotation=Does that mean you're going to let me have the map?

[6030]
Annotation=Fine.  Be that way.  There are other fish in the sea.

[6031]
Annotation=I can see Governor Marley's front yard.

[6032]
Annotation=Comfy.

[6033]
Annotation=I'd better not muss up Elaine's sheets.

[6034]
Annotation="You know, I heard some guys talking about Marley's bust..."

[6035]
Annotation=...this must be it.

[6036]
Annotation=I don't want to break anything.

[6037]
Annotation=Elaine would kill me.

[6038]
Annotation=I don't want to break anything.

[6039]
Annotation=Elaine would kill me.

[6040]
Annotation=It's impolite to stare at a woman's chest.

[6041]
Annotation=It's just a porcelain replica of a chest.

[6042]
Annotation=I hate that knick-knacky junk.

[6043]
Annotation=It sure is big.

[6044]
Annotation=It's slimy and squishy.

[6045]
Annotation=It's a whole mess of fish!

[6046]
Annotation=I don't think I need any more.

[6047]
Annotation=Sorry.

[6048]
Annotation=Dang.

[6049]
Annotation=I don't want to do any more fishing.

[6050]
Annotation=I don't think that would be very sporting.

[6051]
Annotation=I can't reach it.

[6052]
Annotation="Boy, it's a long way down there."

[6053]
Annotation=What a nice map.

[6054]
Annotation=I don't think that will work.

[6055]
Annotation=" Well, you guys can stop worrying about Largo..."

[6056]
Annotation=He's history.

[6057]
 Annotation=I ever tell you about the time I kicked LeChuck's butt?
 
[6058]
Annotation= Tell me about this Largo guy.
 
[6059]
 Annotation=So why don't you kick Largo off the island?
 
[6060]
Annotation=But LeChuck's gone forever!

[6061]
Annotation=That's because I blew it into a thousand pieces!

[6062]
 Annotation=What's this about an embargo?
 
[6063]
Annotation= What's this about an embargo?
 
[6064]
 Annotation=Any idea where I could hire a ship?
 
[6065]
Annotation=Yikes! Sounds intimidating.

[6066]
 Annotation=Do you guys know any piraty songs?
 
[6067]
Annotation= Do you guys know any more piraty songs?
 
[6068]
 Annotation=Any marshmallows left?
 
[6069]
Annotation="What's that white, puffy thing on the end of your stick?"

[6070]
Annotation=" Well, I'll see you salty dogs later."

[6071]
Annotation="So I bust into the church and say, `Now you're in for it, you bilious bag of barnacle bait!`"

[6072]
Annotation=No.

[6073]
Annotation=Bigger than that.

[6074]
Annotation="No, I'm in search of treasure."

[6075]
Annotation=The biggest treasure of them all.

[6076]
Annotation="A treasure so valuable and so well hidden, that it haunts the dreams of every pirate on the seas."

[6077]
Annotation=None other.

[6078]
Annotation="...and then LeChuck cries, `Guybrush! Have mercy!`"

[6079]
Annotation="Well, I didn't know that before!"

[6080]
Annotation=Now I'm trying to charter a ship and look someplace else.

[6081]
Annotation="When I return, I'll have riches galore, and a whole new story."

[6082]
Annotation=`I can't take it anymore!`

[6083]
Annotation="Well, actually, that's why I'm here on Scabb Island."

[6084]
Annotation=I'm on a whole new adventure.

[6085]
Annotation=OK! That's enough!

[6086]
Annotation=No songs about Governor Marley.

[6087]
Annotation=42!

[6088]
Annotation=508!

[6089]
Annotation=4!

[6090]
Annotation="OK, that's enough."

[6091]
 Annotation=How's the pirate biz?
 
[6092]
Annotation=I can't reach that high.

[6093]
Annotation=I can't reach that high.

[6094]
Annotation=Yikes!!!

[6095]
Annotation="Gee, guess it was an antique."

[6096]
Annotation=I don't think it will work with that.

[6097]
Annotation=I don't think that needs a paddling.

[6098]
Annotation=It's not too useful in its present form.

[6099]
Annotation=Hmmm...  I think I get the idea.

[6100]
Annotation=Ouch!

[6101]
Annotation=You came looking for me?

[6102]
Annotation=But I thought you abandoned me!

[6103]
Annotation=So what do you two want?

[6104]
Annotation=Really?

[6105]
Annotation=Great!

[6106]
Annotation=That really hurts!

[6107]
Annotation=What is it?

[6108]
Annotation=Oh.  OK...

[6109]
Annotation=What is it?  What's wrong?

[6110]
Annotation=Why did you leave me again?

[6111]
Annotation=LeChuck!

[6112]
Annotation=But I killed you!

[6113]
Annotation=Wait a minute...

[6114]
Annotation=AAARRRGGGHHH!!!!

[6115]
Annotation=Wow!  What a dream!

[6116]
Annotation=Wow...

[6117]
Annotation=They're good.

[6118]
Annotation=I've gotta write this down!

[6119]
Annotation=Something very strange is going on here...

[6120]
Annotation=Do not attempt to adjust your set!

[6121]
Annotation=Dad!

[6122]
Annotation=Mom!

[6123]
Annotation=What are you two doing here?

[6124]
Annotation="It looks better, stronger, faster."

[6125]
Annotation=But I'm standing on it.

[6126]
Annotation=How rustic.

[6127]
Annotation=`Central Caribbean School for Governors...

[6128]
Annotation=...Crew '67`

[6129]
Annotation=No thanks.

[6130]
Annotation=Only shiny pages left in the catalog.

[6131]
Annotation=Big woodpeckers.

[6132]
Annotation=Looks like a plank stuck in a hole in a tree.

[6133]
Annotation=It's already in use.

[6134]
Annotation=For what?

[6135]
Annotation=It's too high for me to reach.

[6136]
Annotation=One end looks carved so it will fit into holes.

[6137]
Annotation=There's nothing interesting in there.

[6138]
Annotation=It's already open.

[6139]
Annotation=This isn't Monkey Island 1.

[6140]
Annotation=It's hundreds and hundreds of maps!

[6141]
Annotation=I don't care about the rest.

[6142]
Annotation="I don't want them all, and I can't tell which one is Governor Marley's!"

[6143]
Annotation=There are hundreds of them!

[6144]
Annotation="Even if one were a piece of the map to Big Whoop, I would never be able to find it!"

[6145]
Annotation=That's the bird that stole my map!

[6146]
Annotation=No way.  He looks like he bites.

[6147]
Annotation=It's not mine to use.

[6148]
Annotation=It's lovely Booty Island.

[6149]
Annotation=It's crazy...

[6150]
Annotation=...but it just might work.

[6151]
Annotation=Hello?

[6152]
Annotation=Little Guybrush?

[6153]
Annotation=Good boy!

[6154]
Annotation=Run along home now.

[6155]
Annotation=Now that's a good dog.

[6156]
Annotation=That doesn't seem to smell interesting to him.

[6157]
Annotation=Kate's ship sure looks small from way down here.

[6158]
Annotation=This monkey head is too heavy to carry to the surface.

[6159]
Annotation="Considering this game has no drop verb, I'm doomed."

[6160]
Annotation=It's too heavy to swim with.

[6161]
Annotation=Stupid Bug!

[6162]
Annotation=It's so heavy that I won't be able to swim to the surface if I pick it up.

[6163]
Annotation=Akkk!!!

[6164]
Annotation=I'm drowning!

[6165]
Annotation=Gotta drop this thing!

[6166]
Annotation=I wouldn't want to do anything that would devalue it.

[6167]
Annotation=It's too heavy to swim with.

[6168]
Annotation=It looks really heavy.

[6169]
Annotation=What a valuable antique.

[6170]
Annotation=Looks like the anchor rope leading back to Kate's ship.

[6171]
Annotation=I can just swim to the surface.

[6172]
Annotation=I don't need to hitch a ride on the anchor.

[6173]
Annotation=Looks like Kate's anchor.

[6174]
Annotation=That's too heavy to pick up.

[6175]
Annotation=Yuck.

[6176]
Annotation="...but, mmmmmm, I can still smell the pickles."

[6177]
Annotation=It's stuck shut with old grease and pork fat.

[6178]
Annotation=There's something written underneath...

[6179]
Annotation=It's rusted open.

[6180]
Annotation=It's empty.

[6181]
Annotation=It's open.

[6182]
Annotation=It's stuck shut with old grease and pork fat.

[6183]
Annotation=They're empty...

[6184]
Annotation="Why would I want to carry around big, empty, pickle-soaked barrels?"

[6185]
Annotation=Except for the baked-on weenie juice.

[6186]
Annotation="It says, `REMEMBER TO TURN OFF!`"

[6187]
Annotation=It's empty.

[6188]
Annotation=It's full of voodoo crap.

[6189]
Annotation=It's the crate I came here in.

[6190]
Annotation=I'm not hauling LeChuck's stuff anywhere.

[6191]
Annotation=Especially the way he tips.

[6192]
Annotation=I'm not getting back in there!

[6193]
Annotation=It's some kind of strange skeleton statue.

[6194]
Annotation=It's too heavy.

[6195]
Annotation=It's too heavy.

[6196]
Annotation=That is one huge door.

[6197]
Annotation="There is no way, not even in an adventure game that I'd be able to get all those locks open."

[6198]
Annotation=It's a little bitty door.

[6199]
Annotation=If I could just reach my pirate utility belt...

[6200]
Annotation=(gulp)

[6201]
Annotation=It would've been easier if you'd left directions.

[6202]
Annotation="Gee, nice going."

[6203]
Annotation=Stop spitting in my face!

[6204]
Annotation=It's already closed.

[6205]
Annotation=I can't find the little doggie door.

[6206]
Annotation=Yikes!

[6207]
Annotation=Poor Wally.

[6208]
Annotation=It's Wally!!!

[6209]
Annotation=It's locked up tight.

[6210]
Annotation=I'd surely need a key.

[6211]
Annotation=Pretty big.

[6212]
Annotation=He looks like he's in good health.

[6213]
Annotation=I'm sure he'll be able to tell me where the island is.

[6214]
Annotation=I'm going to go get that key!

[6215]
Annotation="Oh yeah, the key."

[6216]
Annotation=I'm going to go have a look around.  Sit tight.

[6217]
Annotation=Wally!

[6218]
Annotation=Are you alright?

[6219]
Annotation=I see.

[6220]
Annotation=What? What?

[6221]
Annotation=How's it hangin'?

[6222]
Annotation=Have you lost weight?  You look good.

[6223]
Annotation="Just stopped by to say hi.  Well, see ya."

[6224]
Annotation="The map, Wally!  What about the map?"

[6225]
Annotation=Who cares?!?

[6226]
Annotation=I have something to confess about your monocle.

[6227]
Annotation=Dread stole it.

[6228]
Annotation="OK, stand back.  I'm going to bust down the door."

[6229]
Annotation=Could you please stop that annoying swinging?

[6230]
Annotation=I can't tell what this stuff is.

[6231]
Annotation=It's too heavy to pick up.

[6232]
Annotation=I can't find the lid in the dark.

[6233]
Annotation="These are crates, but I don't know what's in them."

[6234]
Annotation=They're too heavy to pick up.

[6235]
Annotation=Ha!

[6236]
Annotation=I'll bet LeChuck is really cheesed-off now!

[6237]
Annotation="Hey, Wally?"

[6238]
Annotation=Where are we?

[6239]
Annotation=I can't see anything in here.

[6240]
Annotation=It's too dark to see what I'm doing.

[6241]
Annotation=Holy Skunk Sweat!!!

[6242]
Annotation=Ouch!

[6243]
Annotation=How's the lead bullet going to get to the balloon?

[6244]
Annotation=An ottoman comes to mind.

[6245]
Annotation=Oops...

[6246]
Annotation=Sue me.

[6247]
Annotation=OK.

[6248]
Annotation="As I was saying, we were hanging over the pit of acid."

[6249]
Annotation=Death was so close I could smell his hairy armpits...

[6250]
Annotation=AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!

[6251]
Annotation="Sure, well I--"

[6252]
Annotation="Yes, well, that is..."

[6253]
Annotation=...ah...

[6254]
Annotation="...OK, so I embellished it a little for dramatic effect."

[6255]
Annotation=I can't reach the punching bag from here.

[6256]
Annotation=I can't reach the bellows from here.

[6257]
Annotation=I can't reach the candle from here.

[6258]
Annotation=I can't reach the balloon from here.

[6259]
Annotation=I can't reach the wheel-o-death from here.

[6260]
Annotation=I can't reach the pan from here.

[6261]
Annotation=I can't reach the shield from here.

[6262]
Annotation=I can't reach Wally from here.

[6263]
Annotation=Where do babies come from?

[6264]
Annotation="So, Wally..."

[6265]
Annotation=Isn't it dangerous to leave a pit of acid uncovered?

[6266]
Annotation="Gee, I had a million questions a second ago..."

[6267]
Annotation=Who won the world series in '56?

[6268]
Annotation=Have you ever tried conditioner on that beard?

[6269]
Annotation=Where's the bathroom?

[6270]
Annotation="How much wood would a woodchuck chuck, if a..."

[6271]
Annotation="If this is 4 and this is 2, what's this?"

[6272]
Annotation=What is the secret of Monkey Island?

[6273]
Annotation=Why do adventure games cost so much?

[6274]
Annotation=Why didn't you just shoot me when I came in?

[6275]
Annotation="Ah, nothing."

[6276]
Annotation="I love you, man."

[6277]
Annotation=Could you please scratch my nose?

[6278]
Annotation=Any bright ideas?

[6279]
Annotation=Well?

[6280]
Annotation=Can I open my eyes now?

[6281]
Annotation=Hey!

[6282]
Annotation=Where are the lights?

[6283]
Annotation=Wally!  This is a matter of life and death!

[6284]
Annotation=What?!

[6285]
Annotation=I've got a bad feeling about this...

[6286]
Annotation=Gosh.  I feel even worse when you yell at me.

[6287]
Annotation=Oh.

[6288]
Annotation=It's burning through the rope at an alarming rate...

[6289]
Annotation="If I spit that way, I might hit myself..."

[6290]
Annotation=My mouth is all dried-up.

[6291]
Annotation=Much more of this and he'll be my height.

[6292]
Annotation=I can't really pull that out right now...

[6293]
Annotation=I can't do that from my current position.

[6294]
Annotation=I can't do that from my present position.

[6295]
Annotation=I can't reach him from here.

[6296]
Annotation=I can't reach that from here.

[6297]
Annotation=Hmmm...

[6298]
Annotation=Can't we talk this thing out?

[6299]
Annotation=Geee...I...

[6300]
Annotation=Ummmm...well...

[6301]
Annotation=Hey...

[6302]
Annotation=What's a little root beer between friends...

[6303]
Annotation=What does the candle do?

[6304]
Annotation=What happens when the bag falls on the bellows?

[6305]
Annotation=Whoops. Excuse me.

[6306]
 Annotation=Is this some sort of bribe situation?{var:global_25}
 
[6307]
Annotation=Sure. Take my money. I don't want any trouble.

[6308]
Annotation="Who's gonna make me, shorty?"

[6309]
Annotation=Help!

[6310]
Annotation=Police!

[6311]
Annotation=Then who keeps up the law and maintains order?

[6312]
Annotation=Then who eats the donuts and roughs-up the transients?

[6313]
Annotation=Please! Not in my new coat!

[6314]
Annotation="OK, put me down now and I won't have to hurt you."

[6315]
Annotation=Tough town.

[6316]
Annotation=I guess I should have got those traveler's checks.

[6317]
Annotation="This may be a lot of money, but it's nothing compared to how rich I'll be when I find Big Whoop."

[6318]
Annotation="I think I'm pretty well prepared, financially, for now."

[6319]
Annotation=I should be set for the whole trip with this.

[6320]
Annotation=This should be plenty of money to charter a ship.

[6321]
Annotation=Look at all this!

[6322]
Annotation=I've got enough to buy my own ship--in five different currencies.

[6323]
Annotation=I'll be traveling first class on this treasure hunt.

[6324]
Annotation=It sure took a long time to save all this.

[6325]
Annotation=No more part-time circus work for me.

[6326]
Annotation="Of course, this is only a fraction of what I'll have after I find Big Whoop."

[6327]
Annotation=Hmmm... Maybe I should get a money belt.

[6328]
Annotation=I wonder what I'll buy first...

[6329]
Annotation="Boy, this stuff's heavy."

[6330]
Annotation=I could just look at this money all day.

[6331]
Annotation="Money, money, money."

[6332]
Annotation=I'm confused by this strange urge to squander my wealth on immoral and dangerous vices.

[6333]
Annotation=I wish all those girls who wouldn't go out with me in school could see this!

[6334]
Annotation=`Help wanted.

[6335]
Annotation=One week's salary in advance.

[6336]
Annotation=Inquire below.`

[6337]
Annotation=What a dinky little door.

[6338]
Annotation="I can't dig that, Daddy."

[6339]
Annotation=`THRIFTY-DIG-- For the treasure hunter on a budget.`

[6340]
Annotation=`Welcome to Woodtick`

[6341]
Annotation=`No Trezer huntin zone`

[6342]
Annotation=Oops...

[6343]
Annotation=...I think I broke the sign.

[6344]
Annotation=I'd better not do anymore damage.

[6345]
Annotation=There's no glass in the window.

[6346]
Annotation=I intend to.

[6347]
Annotation=`The Bloody Lip Bar and Grill`

[6348]
Annotation=Is this some sort of bribe situation?

[6349]
Annotation=Sure.  Take my money.  I don't want any trouble.

[6350]
Annotation=I don't pay for nothin'. I'm a pirate!

[6351]
Annotation="I'm sure it's near here, can we try another spot?"

[6352]
Annotation=I got the monkey head!

[6353]
Annotation=Let's head back to Booty Island.

[6354]
Annotation="What did you do, order this ship out of the back of a comic book?"

[6355]
Annotation=There wasn't anything down there.

[6356]
Annotation=The galleon is here!

[6357]
Annotation="This ship is so small, the rats are leaving it humpbacked."

[6358]
Annotation=Whose bathtub did the ship come from?

[6359]
Annotation=I've seen bigger ships in bottles.

[6360]
Annotation=I've seen COFFEE CUPS bigger than this ship.

[6361]
Annotation=I'll dive in and look for the sunken galleon.

[6362]
Annotation="Hey, I can hold my breath for ten minutes!"

[6363]
Annotation=I'll dive in again.

[6364]
Annotation=Let's head back to Booty Island.

[6365]
Annotation=What happens now that I'm here?

[6366]
Annotation="You're weirding me out, I gotta go."

[6367]
Annotation=I was thinking more along the lines of monetary gain.

[6368]
Annotation="Actually, I'm looking for the treasure of Big Whoop."

[6369]
Annotation="Yes, that's quite true."

[6370]
Annotation="Right here, on the beach?"

[6371]
Annotation=What sort of philosophy are you teaching?

[6372]
Annotation=How many students have you got?

[6373]
Annotation="That's nice, but I think I'd best be off now."

[6374]
Annotation=That philosophy isn't worth my time.

[6375]
Annotation=Herman Toothrot!  What are you doing here?

[6376]
Annotation=That seems to have gotten most of the salt out of it.

[6377]
Annotation=Pretty Polly.

[6378]
Annotation=There are some crackers in here.

[6379]
Annotation="Hey, there's a cracker in here."

[6380]
Annotation="There, I think that'll hold."

[6381]
Annotation=What do you mean you've been waiting for me?

[6382]
Annotation=It's about as broken as it's gonna get.

[6383]
Annotation=Looks like I broke the bottle.

[6384]
Annotation=It's a jungle in there.

[6385]
Annotation=I don't think I ought to do that.

[6386]
Annotation=He's meditating.

[6387]
Annotation=What are you doing here?

[6388]
Annotation=I don't think he notices me.

[6389]
Annotation=It doesn't seem interested.

[6390]
Annotation=It's closed.

[6391]
Annotation=It's empty.

[6392]
Annotation=It looks kind of old.

[6393]
Annotation=It's open.

[6394]
Annotation=It's a low-sodium cracker.

[6395]
Annotation=It's dry.

[6396]
Annotation="It's full of fresh, clear water."

[6397]
Annotation=It's full of seawater.

[6398]
Annotation=I think I have an answer to the philosophical puzzle you posed for me.

[6478]
Annotation=There's no more cracker mix.

[6479]
Annotation=This water is too salty to use with low-sodium cracker mix.

[6480]
Annotation=I'm not in the mood for a swim.

[6481]
Annotation=It's full already.

[6482]
Annotation=It's a moonshine still.

[6483]
Annotation=The still's empty.

[6484]
Annotation=I distilled this already.

[6485]
Annotation="It's empty, and there's a cap on it."

[6486]
Annotation=I'd better be careful with this.

[6487]
Annotation=It's not a twist-off.

[6488]
Annotation=Could you teach me some philosophy?

[6489]
Annotation=A what?

[6490]
Annotation=It's about as open as it's going to get.

[6491]
Annotation=It's got a cap on it.

[6492]
Annotation=The cap fell off when I broke it.

[6493]
Annotation=Maybe I could use that martini glass on the beach.

[6494]
Annotation=It's shaped like a giant slug.

[6495]
Annotation=It's shaped like a giant pencil.

[6496]
Annotation=It's shaped like a giant boomerang.

[6497]
Annotation=There's a little dent in it where I hit my head.

[6498]
Annotation=They're already closed.

Annotation=Do you always say things like that?

[6508]
Annotation=Do you mean to tell me that your WHOLE LIFE has been merely a prelude to meeting me here today?

[6509]
Annotation=That's the second biggest X I've ever seen.

[6510]
Annotation=Shortcut?

[6511]
Annotation=I've hit cement!

[6512]
Annotation="It's a good shovel, but I can't dig through cement with it."

[6513]
Annotation=There's a layer of cement at the bottom.

[6514]
Annotation=It looks like there's some sort of cavern down there.

[6515]
Annotation=I might not be able to get out!

[6516]
Annotation=*sigh*

[6517]
Annotation="Well, it all started on Scabb Island."

[6518]
Annotation=Some of my admiring fans had pressured me into telling my LeChuck evaporating story once again...

[6519]
Annotation=Err...

[6520]
Annotation="Hi, Elaine."

[6521]
Annotation=Do you think you could help me out?

[6522]
Annotation=It's kind of a long story.

[6523]
Annotation=That must be the treasure of Big Whoop!

[6524]
Annotation=Shaky.

[6525]
Annotation=I'm not sure that's a good idea.

[6526]
Annotation=Looks as shaky as the one I'm standing on.

[6527]
Annotation=I might knock it off.

[6528]
Annotation="They look sturdy, apart from being all bent up."

[6529]
Annotation=I can't get up there.

[6530]
Annotation=...and you showed up about three days later.

[6531]
Annotation=Will you help me now?

[6532]
Annotation=It looks very big and heavy.

[6533]
Annotation=It's nailed shut.

[6534]
Annotation=I think it's a bit heavy for me.

[6535]
Annotation=`900 pounds`

[6536]
Annotation=It's definitely part of LeChuck's beard.

[6537]
Annotation=It's already closed.

[6538]
Annotation=It's already open.

[6539]
Annotation=The door's closed.

[6540]
Annotation=This is hauntingly familiar...

[6541]
Annotation=Ooooh!  A circus.

[6542]
Annotation=I love a circus!

[6543]
Annotation=`Employees Only`

[6544]
Annotation=The warning tape says closed for construction.

[6545]
Annotation=That would be unlawful.

[6546]
Annotation=The street is closed off.

[6547]
Annotation="Hi. I'm Guybrush Threepwood, LeChuck-busting stud."

[6548]
Annotation=Did I mention that I'm Guybrush the LeChuck-busting stud?

[6549]
Annotation=Hi. I'm Guybrush. Who are you?

[6550]
Annotation=But what IS Big Whoop?

[6551]
Annotation="Excuse me, do you know anything about Big Whoop?"

[6552]
Annotation="Nice place you have here. Well, goodbye."

[6553]
Annotation="I'm sure they are. Well, good-bye."

[6554]
Annotation=Nobody sent me. I'm free-lance.

[6555]
Annotation=I was sent by the I.R.S.  Let me see your files.

[6556]
Annotation=Don't shoot! I was just asking.

[6557]
Annotation="Well, well. Aren't we jumpy?"

[6558]
Annotation="Are you looking for Big Whoop, too?"

[6559]
Annotation="I know I'm looking for it, and that's about it."

[6560]
Annotation=Excuse me...

[6561]
Annotation=My name's Guybrush. Who are you?

[6562]
Annotation=Can I see your files?

[6563]
Annotation=Where do you think it's buried?

[6564]
Annotation=I'm looking for Big Whoop myself. Wanna help?

[6565]
Annotation=I know it contains unimaginable wealth.

[6566]
Annotation=I know it's location is a mystery.

[6567]
Annotation=Um... I really don't know much about it at all.

[6568]
Annotation=No. Tell me all about it.

[6569]
Annotation=Elaine?

[6570]
Annotation=Why don't you believe it?

[6571]
Annotation="No, but I really don't care."

[6572]
Annotation="Oh, them? Yeah, I know about them. Of course."

[6573]
Annotation=Go on. Finish the story.

[6574]
Annotation=Oh yeah--love potion.

[6575]
Annotation=That's what I was supposed to get.

[6576]
Annotation=But what IS Big Whoop?

[6577]
Annotation=Wow. That's some story.

[6578]
Annotation=Where are they now?

[6579]
Annotation="You don't actually believe that story, do you?"

[6580]
Annotation="I love that story. Well, bye!"

[6581]
Annotation=Hey! I did it! Largo LaGrande left Scabb!

[6582]
Annotation=I have some more questions about Scabb Island.

[6583]
Annotation=I have some questions about Scabb Island.

[6584]
Annotation=Do you know anything about Big Whoop?

[6585]
Annotation=Could you tell me about the men who buried Big Whoop?

[6586]
Annotation="You know, I could just sit and talk about maps all day."

[6587]
Annotation=...but unfortunately I don't have all day.

[6588]
Annotation=Hi Wally.

[6589]
Annotation=What exactly do you do here?

[6590]
Annotation=You do open-heart surgery?

[6591]
Annotation=In here?

[6592]
Annotation=Oh.

[6593]
Annotation=You know anything about this Largo guy?

[6594]
Annotation=How's business?

[6595]
Annotation="Is longitude the sideways one, or is that latitude?"

[6596]
Annotation=I can never remember which is which.

[6597]
Annotation=Thanks.  I gotta go.

[6598]
Annotation=Would you mind if I just looked around?

[6599]
Annotation=What kinds of maps do you make?

[6600]
Annotation=Is that all you do? Make maps?

[6601]
Annotation=Ha! Only sissies use maps.

[6602]
Annotation=Not to me. I don't travel.

[6603]
Annotation="Actually, I prefer to just stop and ask directions."

[6604]
Annotation=You know anything about this Largo guy?

[6605]
Annotation="Yeah, tell me about it."

[6606]
Annotation=How's business?

[6607]
Annotation=Where's the Governor's Mansion?

[6608]
Annotation=I'm looking for some room and board.

[6609]
Annotation=How can I get off this island as soon as possible?

[6610]
Annotation=Thanks. That's all I need to know.

[6611]
Annotation=Thanks for the lowdown.

[6612]
Annotation="Actually, I'm trying to get off it as soon as possible."

[6613]
Annotation=Nice monocle.

[6614]
Annotation=I'd rather keep it.

[6615]
Annotation="Pretty nice map, eh?"

[6616]
Annotation=I've got some more pieces right here!

[6617]
Annotation=I've got another piece right here!

[6618]
Annotation=I've got the rest of it right here.

[6619]
Annotation=Can you put it all together into one map for me?

[6620]
Annotation=Okay.

[6621]
Annotation=Nice map.

[6622]
Annotation=Where'd he go?

[6623]
Annotation=Someone's hastily scratched a message here...

[6624]
Annotation="It just says, `LeChuck.`"

[6625]
Annotation="Oh, no!"

[6626]
Annotation=LeChuck's kidnapped the cartographer!

[6627]
Annotation=The poor little guy...

[6628]
Annotation=Hey! He has my map!

[6629]
Annotation="It just says, `LeChuck.`"

[6630]
Annotation=Everything looks all blurry.

[6631]
Annotation=Poor guy.

[6632]
Annotation=I'm not dressed for wrestling.

[6633]
Annotation=I can't reach it.

[6634]
Annotation=It's a pile of blank paper.

[6635]
Annotation=I've got enough.

[6636]
Annotation=It's blank.

[6637]
Annotation=It's too small.

[6638]
Annotation=Reminds me of a dollhouse I once had.

[6639]
Annotation="I mean, my SISTER once had."

[6640]
Annotation=I don't think it's my prescription.

[6641]
Annotation="Maps. Huh. That's interesting. Well, see ya."

[6642]
Annotation="Actually, I'd better not ask too many questions."

[6643]
Annotation=So you've told me.

[6644]
Annotation=It's full of dolls.

[6645]
Annotation=I'll just take one.

[6646]
Annotation=I don't want any more voodoo dolls.

[6647]
Annotation=I don't want to carry around a whole box of dolls.

[6648]
Annotation=It's already closed.

[6649]
Annotation=Whatever for?

[6650]
Annotation=It's an attractive green color.

[6651]
Annotation=It's empty.

[6652]
Annotation=Well...

[6653]
Annotation=I'd rather be a pirate on Scabb...

[6654]
Annotation=Than a scab on a pirate.

[6655]
Annotation=I'm Bobbin Threadbare...

[6656]
Annotation=Are you my mother?

[6657]
Annotation=They're full of root beer.

[6658]
Annotation=StumpMaster brand Stump Balm...

[6659]
Annotation=Guaranteed to prevent stump chafing for the active pirate.

[6660]
Annotation="Oh, there's a monkey in my pocket,"

[6661]
Annotation="And he's stealing all my change,"

[6662]
Annotation="His stare is blank and glassy, I suspect that he's deranged..."

[6663]
Annotation=I love root beer.

[6664]
Annotation=I'd get everything all sticky.

[6665]
Annotation=It's positively PULSING with voodoo energy!

[6666]
Annotation=It's just a cheap little doll with no voodoo powers at all.

[6667]
Annotation=Now you're in for it...

[6668]
Annotation=you bilious bag of barnacle bait!

[6669]
Annotation=It's already open.

[6670]
Annotation="Hey, there's only one balloon in here."

[6671]
Annotation=I don't want to carry a whole box.

[6672]
Annotation="What, all of them?"

[6673]
Annotation=It's a box of balloons.

[6674]
Annotation=There's loads of root beer in here.

[6675]
Annotation=It's full of root beer.

[6676]
Annotation=I wouldn't want to open them ALL.

[6677]
Annotation=One bottle of root beer should be sufficient.

[6678]
Annotation=I don't want a whole box.

[6679]
Annotation=They're full of dolls.

[6680]
Annotation=They're little generic voodoo Kewpie dolls.

[6681]
Annotation=It's probably full of tools and useful stuff.

[6682]
Annotation=It's stuck.

[6683]
Annotation=It's stuck.

[6684]
Annotation=It's probably got all kinds of money and valuables in it.

[6685]
Annotation=It's jammed.

[6686]
Annotation=It's empty.

[6687]
Annotation=It's already open.

[6688]
Annotation=There's nothing to pick up.

[6689]
Annotation=I bet it has all sorts of powerful voodoo supplies inside.

[6690]
Annotation=It's most likely full of technological wonders.

[6691]
Annotation=What a cheap looking costume.

[6692]
Annotation=Must be a pretty small railroad.

[6693]
Annotation=I think it's more of those anchovies.

[6694]
Annotation=It's nailed shut.

[6695]
Annotation=It's missing the head.

[6696]
Annotation=I can't reach that high.

[6697]
Annotation=It's a little lever.

[6698]
Annotation=A veritable fortune.

[6699]
Annotation=It's out of order.

[6700]
Annotation=It looks like it's been here a long time.

[6701]
Annotation=It's probably empty.

[6702]
Annotation=It brings back painful memories.

[6703]
Annotation=That won't do much.

[6704]
Annotation=Wheee!

[6705]
Annotation=I'd really rather not.

[6706]
Annotation=It's too heavy for me to lift.

[6707]
Annotation=It's already filled.

[6708]
Annotation=It's already closed.

[6709]
Annotation=It's my dad.

[6710]
Annotation=Hmm...

[6711]
Annotation=This looks loose.

[6712]
Annotation="Hi, dad."

[6713]
Annotation="Alas, poor Dad."

[6714]
Annotation=It's already closed.

[6715]
Annotation=There's a syringe in here.

[6716]
Annotation=It's empty.

[6717]
Annotation=It's just an ordinary drawer.

[6718]
Annotation=It's already open.

[6719]
Annotation="Boy, that look comfy!"

[6720]
Annotation=Where am I going to put a drawer?

[6721]
Annotation=Yikes!

[6722]
Annotation=I don't like loud noises.

[6723]
Annotation=That wouldn't do much.

[6724]
Annotation=That wouldn't do anything.

[6725]
Annotation=I'd better not.

[6726]
Annotation=Nice trash can.

[6727]
Annotation=There's stuff in it.

[6728]
Annotation=I don't want a trash can.

[6729]
Annotation=It's a pair of surgical gloves.

[6730]
Annotation=This is no time to be playing doctor.

[6731]
Annotation=It's a surgical glove.

[6732]
Annotation="Holy cow, these are my PARENTS!!"

[6733]
Annotation=There's stuff in here.

[6734]
Annotation=It has that austere but functional look.

[6735]
Annotation="I'd love to, but I'm kind of pressed for time."

[6736]
Annotation=It's my mom.

[6737]
Annotation=Dad looks a bit looser...

[6738]
Annotation=I've disturbed them enough.

[6739]
Annotation=This is no time for playing doctor.

[6740]
Annotation=That wouldn't be polite.

[6741]
Annotation="Hi, mom."

[6742]
Annotation=Really?  A treat?

[6743]
Annotation=Am I going to enjoy this?

[6744]
Annotation=I don't suppose it's a LucasArts? game...

[6745]
Annotation=A dolly?  The surprise is a dolly?

[6746]
Annotation="What's with the big, sharp, deadly looking pin?"

[6747]
Annotation=Is this going to be anything like `pin the tail on the donkey`?

[6748]
Annotation="Say, that wouldn't happen to be a voodoo doll, would it?"

[6749]
Annotation="I'll do anything, just please don't do that again!"

[6750]
Annotation=It says `First aid this way.`

[6751]
Annotation=Are you quite finished?

[6752]
Annotation="Hey, I'm alive!"

[6753]
Annotation=I thought I was a goner!

[6754]
Annotation=Whoops...

[6755]
Annotation="Uh, no, that's OK, I--"

[6756]
Annotation=Please!

[6757]
Annotation=No more!

[6758]
Annotation=Aaaiiiiieeee!!!!

[6759]
Annotation=Mama!

[6760]
Annotation=Eek!

[6761]
Annotation=I can't get up there.

[6762]
Annotation=I've been in the dark enough for one day.

[6763]
Annotation=I should push the little button.

[6764]
Annotation=Looks like the elevator is on this floor.

[6765]
Annotation=`Service elevator`

[6766]
Annotation=`1000 pound limit`

[6767]
Annotation=I don't think LeChuck's close enough for it to do anything.

[6768]
Annotation="Boy, what a gyp!"

[6769]
Annotation=What do I want with a bunch of bits of broken treasure chest?

[6770]
Annotation=It says `E` on it.

[6771]
Annotation=It says `Elevator this way.`

[6772]
Annotation="Hello, LeChuck."

[6773]
Annotation="Goodbye, LeChuck."

[6774]
Annotation=Would you mind not spitting so much when you talk?

[6775]
Annotation=Nice echo.

[6776]
Annotation=I can't see a thing.

[6777]
Annotation=Are you sure you want to do this?

[6778]
Annotation=Let me explain.

[6779]
Annotation=Let's bury the hatchet.

[6780]
Annotation=Let bygones be bygones.

[6781]
Annotation=Err...

[6782]
Annotation=Ah...

[6783]
Annotation=Uh...

[6784]
Annotation=Um...

[6785]
Annotation=Let's discuss this like rational adults.

[6786]
Annotation=Yeah?  Just watch me!

[6787]
Annotation=There's no need for violence.

[6788]
Annotation="Take THIS, LeChuck!"

[6789]
Annotation="Take THAT, LeChuck!"

[6790]
Annotation="You know, this doll reminds me of the Stretchy Muscleman I had as a kid."

[6791]
Annotation=I wonder what would happen if I tore the leg off this thing?

[6792]
Annotation=What?

[6793]
Annotation="No way, I'm not that stupid."

[6794]
Annotation="Forget it, I'm not coming over there."

[6795]
Annotation="No chance, you'll just rip my lungs out when I get close."

[6796]
Annotation="Leg or no leg, I trust you about as far as I can throw Manhattan."

[6797]
Annotation="My god, you're..."

[6798]
Annotation=...my creepy brother Chuckie.

[6799]
Annotation="I escaped from you before, I can easily do it again."

[6800]
Annotation="Oh, all right, I'm coming over."

[6801]
Annotation=Why have you been chasing me all over the place?

[6802]
Annotation=Get outta town!

[6803]
Annotation="When our mother told you to hunt me down, did she actually mention KILLING me, or was that your idea?"

[6804]
Annotation=How come you hate me as much as you obviously do?

[6805]
Annotation=No.

[6806]
Annotation=Do you really think a truck is more important than your own BROTHER?

[6807]
Annotation=Will you promise to stop picking on me?

[6808]
Annotation="         No, sir."

[6809]
Annotation=Will you promise not to hold me down and spit on me anymore?

[6810]
Annotation=Will you promise to stop locking me in your footlocker?

[6811]
Annotation=Oh?  Why do you say that?

[6812]
Annotation="Yes, mom."

[6813]
Annotation="OK, mom."

[6814]
Annotation=Like soup and salad?

[6815]
Annotation=That's impossible!

[6816]
Annotation=Noooooooo!!!!

[6817]
Annotation=Huh?

[6818]
Annotation=No!

[6819]
Annotation="No, that's not true!"

[6820]
Annotation="I'm Guybrush Threepwood, a mighty pirate.  I don't have to worry about stuff like that."

[6821]
Annotation=Yeah!

[6822]
Annotation=This is weird.  What's going on here?

[6823]
Annotation=Who are you people?

[6824]
Annotation=What IS this place?

[6825]
Annotation="Take this, BROTHER."

[6826]
Annotation="Hey, nothing's happening!"

[6827]
Annotation="Here, try this."

[6828]
Annotation="Now, isn't that better?"

[6829]
Annotation=Like life and limb?

[6830]
Annotation="You're right, I give up."

[6831]
Annotation=Can't we talk this over?

[6832]
Annotation=Hold on.

[6833]
Annotation=I know you're upset.

[6834]
Annotation=Wait a second.

[6835]
Annotation=Let's not be hasty.

[6836]
Annotation=What's going on?

[6837]
Annotation=Like dreadlocks?

[6838]
Annotation=I think you being my brother is enough of a surprise for one day.

[6839]
Annotation=I can't reach it.

[6840]
Annotation=Pretty Polly.

[6841]
Annotation=I'll just take this rope off of it...

[6842]
Annotation="Hey, it's nailed shut!"

[6843]
Annotation=It's a disgusting bog.

[6844]
Annotation=It looks a bit thick for swimming.

[6845]
Annotation="It used to be full of instant low-sodium cracker mix, but now it's empty."

[6846]
Annotation=It's lit now.

[6847]
Annotation=The fuse is burning down.

[6848]
Annotation="It's not burning very fast, but it's making definite progress."

[6849]
Annotation=More than half the fuse is gone already.

[6850]
Annotation=I think I'd better use this soon.

[6851]
Annotation="Remember kids: if you're under 18, ask your parents before calling."

[6852]
Annotation=There's only about an inch of fuse left.

[6853]
Annotation=There's only about a half-inch of fuse left.

[6854]
Annotation=There's only about a quarter-inch of fuse left.

[6855]
Annotation=I'm getting a bit worried about carrying this around.

[6856]
Annotation=Looks like about an eighth of an inch of fuse left.

[6857]
Annotation=There couldn't be more than a sixteenth of an inch of fuse now.

[6858]
Annotation=I think I'd better use this REALLY soon.

[6859]
Annotation=There's a tiny amount of fuse left.

[6860]
Annotation=I can't really even see the fuse anymore.

[6861]
Annotation="I don't know how much time is left before this blows up, but I'll bet it's not long."

[6862]
Annotation=I'm lost in the Dinky Island jungle in Monkey II.

[6863]
Annotation="Boy, I must be a real idiot, carrying around a bunch of lit dynamite for so long."

[6864]
Annotation=Any minute now...

[6865]
Annotation=I think it's about to explode.

[6866]
Annotation=I bet if I even shake this too hard it will go off!

[6867]
Annotation="I think that might be a dangerous way to open it, after all it DOES say `TNT` on the side."

[6868]
Annotation=It's already open.

[6869]
Annotation=It's tied shut with rope.

[6870]
Annotation=It's nailed shut.

[6871]
Annotation=It's full of dynamite.

[6872]
Annotation=It's empty.

[6873]
Annotation=When is SWOTL going to ship?

[6874]
Annotation=I did that already.

[6875]
Annotation="Hey, dynamite, just like it says on the side!"

[6876]
Annotation=The writing on it says `ages 3 and up.`

[6877]
Annotation=I think a shovel should be sufficient for this soft ground.

[6878]
Annotation="I wouldn't be able to light it again, I'm out of matches."

[6879]
Annotation=I don't want to blow that up.

[6880]
Annotation=That's not such a great idea.

[6881]
Annotation=I don't think it will do much good unless I light it first.

[6882]
Annotation=Looks strong.

[6883]
Annotation=I could probably get the rope off with my hands.

[6884]
Annotation=Who thought up that dumb stump joke?

[6885]
Annotation=I don't think it will catch on there.

[6886]
Annotation=I slashed it up pretty well.

[6887]
Annotation=There's something lumpy in it.

[6888]
Annotation=It's empty already.

[6889]
Annotation=It doesn't seem interested.

[6890]
Annotation="OK, it's closed."

[6891]
Annotation=It's empty.

[6892]
Annotation="Yech, I don't want any of THIS revolting sludge."

[6893]
Annotation="It's instant low-sodium cracker mix, just add water."

[6894]
Annotation="OK, it's open."

[6895]
Annotation=Where do babies come from?

[6896]
Annotation=I think that's a bit too much water.

[6897]
Annotation=It's a low-sodium cracker.
